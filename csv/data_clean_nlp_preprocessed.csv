1. *Setup a* :spotify: *App and get the credentials*
head to <  and setup an app:
1. click on DASHBOARD on the above panel
2. login in with your credentials
3. click ""create an app"", give it a name and if you want a description, tick the :tick_checkmark:, click ""create""
4. click the huge green box (left picture) for your app that was created. You should see your *Client ID* and if you click SHOW CLIENT SECRET, there's your *client secret* (right picture)*.* Especially don't share the latter with anyone / push it to github. You can revoke it though, if you accidentally did.

We need both the client id and the client secret to connect to the Spotify API and use the Spotipy wrapper.

• Tuesday lecture and labs - we will be using jupyter notebook with numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries. Nothing new to install but check that your chosen conda environment (if you are using conda) works with matplotlib and seaborn or use your base jupyter environment.

Regarding the upcoming Lab `Customer Analysis Round 3` : I inspected it and reworked the instructions. Please take the same data, but take these instructions:

&gt; For this lab, we still keep using the `marketing_customer_analysis.csv` file. You can find the file in the `files_for_lab` folder.
&gt; 
&gt; *Get the data*
&gt; Use the same jupyter file from the last lab, `Customer Analysis Round 3`
&gt; 
&gt; *EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) - Complete the following tasks to explore the data:*
&gt; * Show DataFrame info.
&gt; * Describe DataFrame.
&gt; * Show a plot of the total number of `response`s broken down by response kind.
&gt; * Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by the total claim amount.~ Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind. Try a boxplot and distribution plot, for each `response` kind. For the distribution plot, try to plot both kinds of responses in one chart (you can try with seaborn's histplot, using the `hue` parameter).
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by income.~ Create similar plots like in the task before, but for `Income`
&gt; * *NEW*: Create a scatterplot between `total claim amount` and `income`. Play around with the parameters of the scatterplot (markersize? alpha?) and try to identify more features within the data just visually. You can also try different seaborn plots.

general,U01SJKB2MG8,Florian Titze,teacher,"ok, Sian already answered while I was typing. :grin:

The function serves the purpose to be able to ""atomize"" tasks. (Not only) in data analytics, we're facing the problem to be just overwhelmed by the task in front of us. So the general approach is: break the task into smaller tasks, which then get broken down again into smaller tasks etc.... and for the lowest ones, you would write a function, solve that problem, and then go one level up, reusing that function and solve the problem on the next higher difficulty level (related to _First Principles thinking_ I guess).

In practical terms, when it comes to code, this has the advantange that your code is - as Sian said -
• *scalable* (you don't need to reinvent the wheel at higher levels),
• your code is *reusable* for yourself and others,
• your code is *outsourcable* when you put it in functions*,* out of a notebook for example, to keep your Notebook clear and reduced to only the things you want to show (most of the time, it's the results). You would then import it as we import e.g. pandas right now, `from my_module import my_function` (we can have a workshop on that)
•  it's *robust.* if one function fails to do the job, it may break, but the rest of the code may continue running. You can even implement Error handling in exactly that function to get information in case of an error, why it failed (comes later in the bootcamp, crucial for example in _Webscraping_)
• it's easier to maintain / repair / upgrade. Dependencies are much easier to handle etc.
• Personal feeling: It feels nicer in my head to solve a problem piece by piece

• Sunday, week 7 - Having optimised their linkedin &amp; CV WITH resumeworded to a score of at least 70
[09:19] the reason why i split this is because they only have a 60 premium access to resumeworded, which I want them to activate in the 2nd half of their bootcamp.

So after the deadline week 3, I am doing a workshop in week 4 on wednesday evening to already give them an understanding what recruiters look out for. Weeks 4-7 are more for optimisation because that’s also when the bootcamp starts getting busier.

1. Select all the actors with the first name ‘Scarlett’.
2. How many films (movies) are available for rent and how many films have been rented?
3. What are the shortest and longest movie duration? Return the results as columns with the names  `max_duration` and `min_duration`.
4. What's the average movie duration expressed in format (hours, minutes) Return the result as columns with the names `hours` and `minutes`?
5. How many distinct (different) actors' last names are there?
6. Since how many days has the company been operating (check the `DATEDIFF()` function)? Hint: rental table
7. Show all rental information with additional columns `month` and `weekday`. (hint: `DATE_FORMAT()` ). Get 20 results.
8. Add an additional column `day_type` with values _'weekend'_ and _'workday'_ depending on the rental day of the week.
9. How many rentals were made in the last month of renting activity?

:microscope: for *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.6*
please use these instructions

1. Get the unique release years.
2. Get all films with _ARMAGEDDON_ in the title.
3. Get all films which title ends with _APOLLO_.
4. Get 10 the longest films.
5. How many films include *Behind the Scenes* content?
6. Drop column `picture` from `staff`.
7. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.
8. Add a rental for movie ""Academy Dinosaur"" by the customer ""Charlotte Hunter"" from employee Mike Hillyer at Store 1. You can use current date for the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table. *Hint*: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there. You can query those pieces of information in other tables. For eg., you would notice that you need `customer_id` information as well. To get that you can use the following query: 
```select customer_id from sakila.customer
where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER';```
Use similar method to get `inventory_id`, `film_id`, and `staff_id`.

9. *(Optional, you can skip this)* Delete non-active users, but first, create a _backup table_ `deleted_users` to store `customer_id`, `email`, and the `date` (use `CURDATE()` , < |link>) for the users that would be deleted. Follow these steps:
    ◦ Check if there are any non-active users
    ◦ Create a table _`backup table`_ as suggested
    ◦ Insert the non active users in the table _`backup table`_
    ◦ Delete the non active users from the table _`customer`_",1635,6,3,True,Tuesday,Weekday,10,Morning,6,April,0,0,nofile,False,nolink,False,False,"{'neg': 0.006, 'neu': 0.929, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': 0.9348}",0.9348,pos,channel microscope lab sql query lesson please use instruction get unique release year get film armageddon title get film title end apollo get longest film many film include behind scene content drop column picture staff new person hired help jon name tammy sander customer update database accordingly add rental movie academy dinosaur customer charlotte hunter employee mike hillyer store use current date rental date column rental table hint check column table rental see information would need add query piece information table eg would notice need customer id information well get use following query select customer id sakila customer first name charlotte last name hunter use similar method get inventory id film id staff id optional skip delete non active user first create backup table deleted user store customer id email date use curdate link user would deleted follow step check non active user create table backup table suggested insert non active user table backup table delete non active user table customer,microscope lab sql query lesson please use instruction get unique release year get film armageddon title get film title end apollo get longest film many film include behind scene content drop column picture staff new person hire help jon name tammy sander customer update database accordingly add rental movie academy dinosaur customer charlotte hunter employee mike hillyer store use current date rentaldate column rental table hint check column table rental see information would need add query piece information table eg would notice need customerid information well get use follow query select customerid sakilacustomerwhere firstname charlotte lastname hunteruse similar method get inventoryid filmid staffid optional skip delete nonactive user first create backup table deletedusers store customerid email date use curdate link user would delete follow step check nonactive user create table backup table suggest insert non active user table backup table delete non active user table customer

• the lollipop chart needs a little work - looks to me, when furniture is selected, as if the axes arent snyc’d anymore, as the circle  is somehow offset from the bar (not a problem on office supplies), but also the bars and circles could be adjusted to align better.

without legends on the scatter plots having the multiple trend lines are hard to interpret - can you think about adding legends , having just one trend line , and instead of lots of small coloured circles which clash with the trend line, you could potentially eliminate all the extra colours or have one grey trend line.

so what I can see quickly is that although you have Year in your beer data, I cant see any evidence you have london borough, in your beer data - hence the price of beer would be the same for all parts of london - is that what you expected ?  price ranges from 2.26 in 2003/4 to 3.70 in 2019/20, which does feel cheap for london!

as to your visualisation, you are using the size of bars, over the top of the map - but this is duplicated encoding, because you have created a copy of latitude, then changed the display of latitude to bars, even though its just displaying the same information as on the original map.

finalproject,U01SJKB2MG8,Florian Titze,teacher,"probably more a question for <#C01S58JN5FT|lab-help>. But anyway...
Yeah, mostly correct. Although there's no hierarchy.

The output (let it be `y_predict` ) is an array with values of the different ""classes"" (like the four flower species in the iris dataset). It is of equal length as the feature dataframe (let it be `X_test` ) which you put in the model to predict them. The metrics for classification (< |True negatives, True positives, False negatives, False positives, accuracy score, F1 error, F2 error, accuracy, precision, recall>, ... ) are then calculated (or directly observable in the confusion matrix) by comparing `y_predict` with `y_test` . The latter is the _Truth,_ the first is the _predicted._ One basically looks for every pair of `y_predic` and `y_test` , how many are there of each combination? And then the confusion matrix is nothing but a tally chart of those possible combinations of the two arrays and in a best case scenario you only have matching pairs, which results in the fact that TN's and TP's are maximized.

So, to answer your last question: No, the order of the predicted label array `y_predicted` doesn't contain any hierarchy. It's just what your model has predicted for every corresponding line of your input dataframe",1355,0,0,False,Wednesday,Weekday,15,Afternoon,12,May,0,0,nofile,False,nolink,False,False,"{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.144, 'compound': 0.97}",0.97,pos,probably question c jn ft lab help anyway yeah mostly correct although hierarchy output let predict array value different class like four flower specie iris dataset equal length feature dataframe let x test put model predict metric classification true negative true positive false negative false positive accuracy score f error f error accuracy precision recall calculated directly observable confusion matrix comparing predict test latter truth first predicted one basically look every pair predic test many combination confusion matrix nothing tally chart possible combination two array best case scenario matching pair result fact tn tp maximized answer last question order predicted label array predicted contain hierarchy model predicted every corresponding line input dataframe,probably question csjnftlabhelp anywayyeah mostly correct although there hierarchythe output let ypredict array value different class like four flower specie iris dataset equal length feature dataframe let xtest put model predict metric classification true negative true positive false negative false positive accuracy score f error f error accuracy precision recall calculate directly observable confusion matrix compare ypredict ytest latter truth first predict one basically look every pair ypredic ytest many combination confusion matrix nothing tally chart possible combination two array best case scenario match pair result fact tn tps maximizedso answer last question order predict label array ypredicted doesnt contain hierarchy model predict every correspond line input dataframe

this gets you half of the way there… in real life I would normally run the query *select max(return_date) from rental* first, spot that the max month is 9 and then just hard code 9 into my code :
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*

…. however to do it programmatically, rather than manually, involves either a subquery or a self join - subquery would be the better way to go.

most of the time in the histograms created in python you are systematically ‘binning’ the data points, as in grouping up the values into buckets, so you should see a bar in your histogram which covers similar values, ie the first bar might account for  all the values between 50 and 58, and the next bar would be all values between 58 and 66 .. try experimenting with the bin size as this might help it make more visual sense to you

if you want to hop on a breakout room and talk it through let me know.
One way to think about averages/counts:
if i do a *select count(column) from table* - i will get one value back - think of *select count(student_name) from bootcamp* - the answer is 23.
same rule applies with *select avg(age) from bootcamp* - the answer is probably around 26
if i want to see more than one row i need to do a group by on each column that isn’t the value aggregated
*- select count(student_name), gender from bootcamp* 
*group by gender* 
would return male : 15 , female:8

I always start with joining the tables i need, select all the fields i want to use across the tables, then think about doing the aggregation using count/avg + groupby

I try to scrape a webpage and it seems they have some protection measures in place.
I can extract some info but after approx. 38 iterations over 38 different webpages I only get gibberish back in my soup (example below).
If I type in the request manually 5 seconds later, I get the soup as it should be…
Any ideas?
Next step I am thinking about is to rotate IPs. But maybe it is not that complicated and you guys had the same problem?!

Thanks

labhelp,U01SJKB2MG8,Florian Titze,teacher,"<!channel>,
maybe a more clearer description about what the next step is for today. Start at *2.* Point *1.* is just to establish the link to the previous project steps.
1. Determine the audio features of the input song by querying the Spotify API with it. Store that result in a dataframe or numpy array (if the latter, keep track of which element in the array corresponds to which feature). Don't spend too much time on implementing any guessing that should be done by your program (whether user inputs the correct song). To get a working recommender ready, first assume that the user puts in a track name and/or an artist that *exactly matches* how they are stored in the spotify database.
2. take the vastness of songs you have collected together with their audio features and train a k-means model with them - similar how we did in lecture (scaling is important!). Keep in mind, that it doesn't make sense to train a model, when you have *artist* or *title* *name* or *track id* in the data. You need to however have the possibility to later (after your model has determined the cluster ids) reassign the correct *track ids* to the *rows. Y*ou can do this by just adding back the track id to the dataframe that contains the determined *cluster id's,* but of course only if you haven't shuffled your data rowwise. You can optimize a bit the parameters, but for a first iteration of your model, just go with the default values of KMeans and stick with it. Only improve later by tuning the parameters.
3. ""Predicting"" which *cluster id* a song belongs to, would work like this: take the audio-features of the song and put it into a numpy array, let's say `song_array`. The audio feature order must exactly match the order that the model has learned. Call the model with `KMeans.predict(song_array)` to make the prediction. The outcome is only one cluster

`customer lifetime value` for example is recognized as categorical - actually I would clean it first, cast it as float and add it to the numericals.

so answer: Double check what your first selection of numericals and categoricals is if you use for example `df.select_dtypes(np.number)`

Regarding dropping: Be careful if you drop rows in the categoricals or numericals dataframe only. Because if you later stitch them together, you end up with dataframes differing in length. What I would do here: Not drop any rows in the splitted numericals and categoricals. But before, immediately after concatenating the three dataframes (let's say your dataframe is then `df_all`) , at least drop the rows that have `NaN` values *only*

To be money, a given unit of account like salt, metal or whatever you want must satisfy several requirements. One of this is to be an effetive unit of account, in that its value does not oscillate wildly with time, like in a scenario of hyperinflation. In short, it must effectively guide expectations for the wide public. If the chinese criptocurrency works exactly like bitcoin it wont have this property, at least not for everyone. I guess forcing people to use it before a certain deadline is a form of stabilizing its value. But I agree with you that this does not make sense if the other objective is to make it attractive for the regular investor and thus grant it with liquidity, which is another one of the desirable properties of money. I guess that not only the Chinese, but also the Americans and the Europeans, which probably will experiment with this policy solution, will have to find an adequate mix here..
