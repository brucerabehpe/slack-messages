Attend the CV &amp; LinkedIn workshop on Wednesday, 14th April at 6pm to get an idea of what recruiters look at &amp; how
After the workshop in week 4, activate resumeworded* premium and use their BASIC word template to optimise the content based on the tool’s feedback by using the function “Resume Targeting” which requires you to upload a job ad of your choice to get an effective scoring
Reach a score of 70 minimum and copy &amp; paste the optimised content from the resumeworded template to your final CV design
Upload the final CV design and LinkedIn URL to Careerhack on your student portal, so I can approve them via the system
(make sure the sharing option of the CV file is accessible)

Two things need to be done by you before or during (depeding on how quick you are with those things) Wednesday's lecture:

1. *Setup a* :spotify: *App and get the credentials*
head to <https://developer.spotify.com/> and setup an app:
1. click on DASHBOARD on the above panel
2. login in with your credentials
3. click ""create an app"", give it a name and if you want a description, tick the :tick_checkmark:, click ""create""
4. click the huge green box (left picture) for your app that was created. You should see your *Client ID* and if you click SHOW CLIENT SECRET, there's your *client secret* (right picture)*.* Especially don't share the latter with anyone / push it to github. You can revoke it though, if you accidentally did.

We need both the client id and the client secret to connect to the Spotify API and use the Spotipy wrapper.

"Software and Hardware setup requirements for this week (unit2):
• Monday - no additional setup needed, you will be primarily working on your project - in python/ pandas/numpy. Ensure you can actively participate in your group by testing your audio/ video on zoom. If this is not possible on your laptop, try the zoom app on your phone or tablet
• Tuesday - zoom - as we have class presentations in the morning, any and all of you should be able to share your screen. Please enable/ test this, plus testing audio functionality / internet speed tests as appropriate eg <https://zoom.us/test|test zoom>, <https://www.speedtest.net/|test speed> 
• Tuesday lecture and labs - we will be using jupyter notebook with numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries. Nothing new to install but check that your chosen conda environment (if you are using conda) works with matplotlib and seaborn or use your base jupyter environment. 
• Wednesday + Thursday we all will need tableau public (minimum) or tableau desktop (optional) 2021 version. I have given you a lab for tuesday afternoon to complete this setup. I would recommending using the quickstart (same lab) to ensure your laptops can cope with tableau and zoom. Unfortunately tableau is memory hungry and there are minimum tech specs listed <https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/products/techspecs|here> - the alternative on the day will be to work on a browser version, so do let us know if you are struggling with your hardware/RAM so we can prepare for this.

Regarding the upcoming Lab `Customer Analysis Round 3` : I inspected it and reworked the instructions. Please take the same data, but take these instructions:

&gt; For this lab, we still keep using the `marketing_customer_analysis.csv` file. You can find the file in the `files_for_lab` folder.
&gt; 
&gt; *Get the data*
&gt; Use the same jupyter file from the last lab, `Customer Analysis Round 3`
&gt; 
&gt; *EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) - Complete the following tasks to explore the data:*
&gt; * Show DataFrame info.
&gt; * Describe DataFrame.
&gt; * Show a plot of the total number of `response`s broken down by response kind.
&gt; * Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by the total claim amount.~ Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind. Try a boxplot and distribution plot, for each `response` kind. For the distribution plot, try to plot both kinds of responses in one chart (you can try with seaborn's histplot, using the `hue` parameter).
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by income.~ Create similar plots like in the task before, but for `Income`
&gt; * *NEW*: Create a scatterplot between `total claim amount` and `income`. Play around with the parameters of the scatterplot (markersize? alpha?) and try to identify more features within the data just visually. You can also try different seaborn plots. Check to find suitable ones: <https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/134-how-to-avoid-overplotting-with-python>",U01SJKB2MG8,12.0,4.0,general,3,March,Weekday,12:38,nofile,nolink_infiles,Florian Titze,3

"ok, Sian already answered while I was typing. :grin:

The function serves the purpose to be able to ""atomize"" tasks. (Not only) in data analytics, we're facing the problem to be just overwhelmed by the task in front of us. So the general approach is: break the task into smaller tasks, which then get broken down again into smaller tasks etc.... and for the lowest ones, you would write a function, solve that problem, and then go one level up, reusing that function and solve the problem on the next higher difficulty level (related to _First Principles thinking_ I guess).

In practical terms, when it comes to code, this has the advantange that your code is - as Sian said -
• *scalable* (you don't need to reinvent the wheel at higher levels),
• your code is *reusable* for yourself and others,
• your code is *outsourcable* when you put it in functions*,* out of a notebook for example, to keep your Notebook clear and reduced to only the things you want to show (most of the time, it's the results). You would then import it as we import e.g. pandas right now, `from my_module import my_function` (we can have a workshop on that)
•  it's *robust.* if one function fails to do the job, it may break, but the rest of the code may continue running. You can even implement Error handling in exactly that function to get information in case of an error, why it failed (comes later in the bootcamp, crucial for example in _Webscraping_)
• it's easier to maintain / repair / upgrade. Dependencies are much easier to handle etc.
• Personal feeling: It feels nicer in my head to solve a problem piece by piece
Of course, all of this is merely theoretical at this point but as tasks become more and more complex, you're starting to whish for functions :slightly_smiling_face:",U01SJKB2MG8,,,general,3,March,Weekday,17:35,nofile,nolink,Florian Titze,0

"What's more overwhelming at this time of the course is to know that this things arent yet authomatic. You tell us something, and we modify it it.

"well, I would say, functions in a programming world are conceptually not really different compared to your example.... in python it would maybe be something like this:
```def get_gdp(c, i, g, t, x, m):
  y = c + i + (g - t) - (x - m)
  return y```
they also just mimic the concept of functions in math as a relation between two sets (elements of set X are associated with exactly one element of set Y). With the difference in programming being that functions can perform so much more that just project from one set to another",U01SJKB2MG8,,,general,3,March,Weekday,20:30,nofile,nolink,Florian Titze,0

We did this event last bootcamp and it was alot of fun, some students had to protect the world against a deadly zombie virus while others had to defuse an atomic bom!!_

*Hang*  [09:17]
Hey @sian d, thanks for raising it! I gave them 2 deadlines.

• Sunday, week 3 - Having applied all suggestions from Careerhack  stage 1 on their linkedin &amp; CV (without activating the optimisation tool, resumeworded)
• Sunday, week 7 - Having optimised their linkedin &amp; CV WITH resumeworded to a score of at least 70
[09:19] the reason why i split this is because they only have a 60 premium access to resumeworded, which I want them to activate in the 2nd half of their bootcamp.

So after the deadline week 3, I am doing a workshop in week 4 on wednesday evening to already give them an understanding what recruiters look out for. Weeks 4-7 are more for optimisation because that’s also when the bootcamp starts getting busier.

 :microscope: *regarding the today's labs (after lecture/lunch)*
please stick to these ""improved"" instructions (and not the ones you find under the github link):

• *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.5*
1. Select all the actors with the first name ‘Scarlett’.
2. How many films (movies) are available for rent and how many films have been rented?
3. What are the shortest and longest movie duration? Return the results as columns with the names  `max_duration` and `min_duration`.
4. What's the average movie duration expressed in format (hours, minutes) Return the result as columns with the names `hours` and `minutes`?
5. How many distinct (different) actors' last names are there?
6. Since how many days has the company been operating (check the `DATEDIFF()` function)? Hint: rental table
7. Show all rental information with additional columns `month` and `weekday`. (hint: `DATE_FORMAT()` ). Get 20 results.
8. Add an additional column `day_type` with values _'weekend'_ and _'workday'_ depending on the rental day of the week.
9. How many rentals were made in the last month of renting activity?

"<!channel>,
:microscope: for *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.6*
please use these instructions

1. Get the unique release years.
2. Get all films with _ARMAGEDDON_ in the title.
3. Get all films which title ends with _APOLLO_.
4. Get 10 the longest films.
5. How many films include *Behind the Scenes* content?
6. Drop column `picture` from `staff`.
7. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.
8. Add a rental for movie ""Academy Dinosaur"" by the customer ""Charlotte Hunter"" from employee Mike Hillyer at Store 1. You can use current date for the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table. *Hint*: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there. You can query those pieces of information in other tables. For eg., you would notice that you need `customer_id` information as well. To get that you can use the following query: 
```select customer_id from sakila.customer
where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER';```
Use similar method to get `inventory_id`, `film_id`, and `staff_id`.

9. *(Optional, you can skip this)* Delete non-active users, but first, create a _backup table_ `deleted_users` to store `customer_id`, `email`, and the `date` (use `CURDATE()` , <https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_curdate.asp|link>) for the users that would be deleted. Follow these steps:
    ◦ Check if there are any non-active users
    ◦ Create a table _`backup table`_ as suggested
    ◦ Insert the non active users in the table _`backup table`_
    ◦ Delete the non active users from the table _`customer`_",U01SJKB2MG8,6.0,3.0,general,1,April,Weekday,10:27,nofile,nolink,Florian Titze,0

Who would be interested in an *optional* workshop in *Object Oriented Programming* in Python?

_Why would I need that?_
• absolutely *no* requirement for a Data Analyst role
• if at all, used in the Data Science field
• to get a deeper understanding of how Python works (what's all the fuss about `class` es in Python?)
• to tip your toes into techniques on how to make code scalable, more easily maintanable - and in the end, solve problems more elegantly

"As one of our follow up actions from yesterdays poll :

• for this weeks GNOD project - I have put a very simple minimum viable product together in jupyter notebook which takes a user input (song name) and compares it to the top 100 to provide a song recommendation. This is for the first product image (shown in the notebook) and can be adapted to the names / columns of your own top 100 variables.
• in addition, this could, of course, be extended for the second version of the product (the spotipy songs+ features, kaggle database, unsupervised clustering) , and can be added to by modularising the scraping code, recommender function, spotipy code etc

"staphney is your middle name? so pretty!

I love the background colour and all the white space you’ve chosen to go for  - i think it makes it look nice and clean. Also you have gone for very minimal labels - its a style i haven’t seen before---im not 100% with you :slightly_smiling_face: , but i like the way you have executed that. Good choice of simple colour scheme, not overwhelming.
• it would be nice if the profit filter controlled the other charts too - so we saw the top customer list and category view change. 
• also it would be nice if the category filter controlled more than one chart
• the lollipop chart needs a little work - looks to me, when furniture is selected, as if the axes arent snyc’d anymore, as the circle  is somehow offset from the bar (not a problem on office supplies), but also the bars and circles could be adjusted to align better. Typically the top of the lollipop is bigger than the width of the bar.
• check your map- in line with my rule of users will do anything you dont want them to, i could zoom out on the map - I normally turn off that zoom or switch to pan mode when publishing a map
• i really like that the map filters the other charts - but you could edit those tooltips to make them look nicer / be more relevant ",U01RW140HBP,,,dvizbeauties,2,April,Weekday,07:02,https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T01RBRV5F7H-F020F14KKQU/image.png?t=xoxe-1861879185255-2047593969042-2053756158948-4cf6552631c579c36efd5d2fd242de30,nolink,noname,0

"I agree with Thamo, nice idea to show the lapsed customers in a staggered kind of bar chart :slightly_smiling_face: i would consider the placement of your two colour legends on the right… i feel like you dont need the legend for RFM rc tier as you have the headers in the chart itself. The other legend (the customer segments) you could show the names of the segments in the bar chart and lose that legend too, or float it, in the white space above the big yellow bar.
In general its a good idea to avoid axis which make us have to turn our heads sideways :owl:- theres one axis label doing that now, on your rfm rc tier bar chart.
nice job on the comments - try making that font bold and a bit bigger?
agree with Marian -  put white font on the grey header blocks- i would even add a matching grey outline to the charts to hold it all together

"its great that your region filter affects everything, but the date filter only changes the map, which could be a bit confusing because thats not near the map, its at the top of the dashboard - i would expect it to filter everything.

"not quite the dashboard lab we were working on but ok!
without legends on the scatter plots having the multiple trend lines are hard to interpret - can you think about adding legends , having just one trend line , and instead of lots of small coloured circles which clash with the trend line, you could potentially eliminate all the extra colours or have one grey trend line. Once a scatter plot gets visually busy its worth switching from shape to circles, which can be faded, and show the density better with an outline, so I would have  think about that.
nice use of the bold blue headings - watch out for the _condition of property_ axis, its quite squeezed and the label doesnt fully display on my laptop- in fact you can drop the axis labels i think as each scatter contains the same information on x and y",U01RW140HBP,,,dvizbeauties,2,April,Weekday,13:47,https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T01RBRV5F7H-F01V9FZTKC7/image.png?t=xoxe-1861879185255-2047593969042-2053756158948-4cf6552631c579c36efd5d2fd242de30,nolink,noname,0

i like the floating layout, making best use of your space. I would drop the grid lines from the bar charts to keep the whole look clean, or do the same as you did with the lollipop chart - looks like they are really faded out.
Did you consider creating a dashboard title ? it feels sort of lost without it.

the profit legend could go further up the map, nearer to the view title, the category legend is possible unnecessary - something to be careful of - that legend is placed next to california at the moment, which also is blue - suggesting california is furniture, so consider your colour choices.

with so much space going for the  map i think you need to have more information on your tooltip, maybe a viz in tooltip ? but certainly clean the tooltips up a bit!",U01RW140HBP,,,dvizbeauties,2,April,Weekday,13:58,nofile,nolink,siand the LT (she/her),1

so what I can see quickly is that although you have Year in your beer data, I cant see any evidence you have london borough, in your beer data - hence the price of beer would be the same for all parts of london - is that what you expected ?  price ranges from 2.26 in 2003/4 to 3.70 in 2019/20, which does feel cheap for london!

as to your visualisation, you are using the size of bars, over the top of the map - but this is duplicated encoding, because you have created a copy of latitude, then changed the display of latitude to bars, even though its just displaying the same information as on the original map.
what are you trying to show on the map ? because if i strip the bars away we just have a map and beer, then it makes sense",U01RW140HBP,,,dvizbeauties,1,May,Weekday,16:21,nofile,nolink,siand the LT (she/her),0

great question about the top n filter on customers - what you need is to add the state to context filters (goes grey) which means the state filter applies before the top 5 filter  - its a matter of clicking on that action filter in the top 5 customer view and selecting ‘add to context’,U01RW140HBP,,,dvizbeauties,1,April,Weekday,13:40,https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T01RBRV5F7H-F01VCR0MV38/image.png?t=xoxe-1861879185255-2047593969042-2053756158948-4cf6552631c579c36efd5d2fd242de30,nolink,noname,0

some tips - i think you could get away without the label ‘borough name’ at least on one of the charts - because its quite intuitive. the chart on the bottom right - i feel like you need a better header that doesnt run out of space.  - maybe something short like ‘popln / borough’

"<@U01RW140HBP> is there a way to use max as window function without partition? I was experimenting and trying to filter results where return_date is equal to max return_date. something like:

from sakila.RENTAL;

i would do this with a self join… hold that thought,U01RW140HBP,,,labhelp,3,April,Weekday,08:05,nofile,nolink,siand the LT (she/her),0
"so the challenge you have here is you cant use the window function as part of the where clause due to the order of execution … they are created in the Select, so cant also be used in Select:
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
this gets you half of the way there… in real life I would normally run the query *select max(return_date) from rental* first, spot that the max month is 9 and then just hard code 9 into my code :
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) = 9* 
…. however to do it programmatically, rather than manually, involves either a subquery or a self join - subquery would be the better way to go.
*select * , month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) =*

then your INSERT INTO statement. But i think you will find there are some constraints on the table which require inserting more information than you have here. if you check the create statement for this table you will see we cant have null entries for
*first name* 
*last name* 
*address id* 
*store id* 
*user name.*
what this means is you will get an error if you try to partially fill a record not completing all those cells.
to get all that information, because we know Tammy is already a customer, you can query her records
*SELECT * FROM sakila.customer*
*where first_name = ‘Tammy’*
then you can amend your insert into statement to include that info
*insert into sakila.staff(first_name, last_name,  address_id, store_id, username)*

"so a granular histogram is just counting the unique values… you would only see a count of more than 1 (ie a bar above average length) where the same exact value was replicated across multiple cities. I wonder if thats likely in this data set ?
most of the time in the histograms created in python you are systematically ‘binning’ the data points, as in grouping up the values into buckets, so you should see a bar in your histogram which covers similar values, ie the first bar might account for  all the values between 50 and 58, and the next bar would be all values between 58 and 66 .. try experimenting with the bin size as this might help it make more visual sense to you

You have to either overwrite `file3` with the output of that or use the `inplace=True` switch. Otherwise your changes won't be permanent. You just get an output shown, but no changes are made on the dataframe itself. So do something like

```file3 = file3.rename(columns={ 'state':'ST'})```

```file3.rename(columns={ 'state':'ST'}, inplace=True)```

"<!channel>,
maybe a more clearer description about what the next step is for today. Start at *2.* Point *1.* is just to establish the link to the previous project steps.
1. Determine the audio features of the input song by querying the Spotify API with it. Store that result in a dataframe or numpy array (if the latter, keep track of which element in the array corresponds to which feature). Don't spend too much time on implementing any guessing that should be done by your program (whether user inputs the correct song). To get a working recommender ready, first assume that the user puts in a track name and/or an artist that *exactly matches* how they are stored in the spotify database.
2. take the vastness of songs you have collected together with their audio features and train a k-means model with them - similar how we did in lecture (scaling is important!). Keep in mind, that it doesn't make sense to train a model, when you have *artist* or *title* *name* or *track id* in the data. You need to however have the possibility to later (after your model has determined the cluster ids) reassign the correct *track ids* to the *rows. Y*ou can do this by just adding back the track id to the dataframe that contains the determined *cluster id's,* but of course only if you haven't shuffled your data rowwise. You can optimize a bit the parameters, but for a first iteration of your model, just go with the default values of KMeans and stick with it. Only improve later by tuning the parameters.
3. ""Predicting"" which *cluster id* a song belongs to, would work like this: take the audio-features of the song and put it into a numpy array, let's say `song_array`. The audio feature order must exactly match the order that the model has learned. Call the model with `KMeans.predict(song_array)` to make the prediction. The outcome is only one cluster
4. The recommendation would then work like this: Take the determined cluster id from *2.* and subset your spotipy dataframe to filter for this cluster with e.g. `df[df[""cluster_id'']==2]` and get a random song back from that subset. You can take a look at <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sample.html|pandas.DataFrame.sample>",U01SJKB2MG8,,,labhelp,3,May,Weekday,11:33,nofile,nolink,Florian Titze,1

"good points! these are exactly the challenges to come across with real world data :slightly_smiling_face:
`customer lifetime value` for example is recognized as categorical - actually I would clean it first, cast it as float and add it to the numericals.

so answer: Double check what your first selection of numericals and categoricals is if you use for example `df.select_dtypes(np.number)`

Regarding dropping: Be careful if you drop rows in the categoricals or numericals dataframe only. Because if you later stitch them together, you end up with dataframes differing in length. What I would do here: Not drop any rows in the splitted numericals and categoricals. But before, immediately after concatenating the three dataframes (let's say your dataframe is then `df_all`) , at least drop the rows that have `NaN` values *only*
You can find those out for example with
```df_all.isna().all(axis=1)```",U01SJKB2MG8,,,labhelp,1,March,Weekday,17:17,https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T01RBRV5F7H-F01RZMSSGLE/screenshot_2021-03-23_customer_analysis_round_1_-_jupyter_notebook.png?t=xoxe-1861879185255-2047593969042-2053756158948-4cf6552631c579c36efd5d2fd242de30,nolink,noname,1

"Reflecting more about it, there is a reason why the Chinese force people to use it in a certain period of time. To be money, a given unit of account like salt, metal or whatever you want must satisfy several requirements. One of this is to be an effetive unit of account, in that its value does not oscillate wildly with time, like in a scenario of hyperinflation. In short, it must effectively guide expectations for the wide public. If the chinese criptocurrency works exactly like bitcoin it wont have this property, at least not for everyone. I guess forcing people to use it before a certain deadline is a form of stabilizing its value. But I agree with you that this does not make sense if the other objective is to make it attractive for the regular investor and thus grant it with liquidity, which is another one of the desirable properties of money. I guess that not only the Chinese, but also the Americans and the Europeans, which probably will experiment with this policy solution, will have to find an adequate mix here..

They often do this by ‘generating’ news that drives price into retail stops or force margin calls with large swings of price.

"i’ve been going back over the Kaggles chapters on Pandas that were posted here a little while back

on <https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/summary-functions-and-maps|Summary Functions and Maps> there’s this part

```map() is the first, and slightly simpler one. For example, suppose that we wanted to remean the scores the wines received to 0. We can do this as follows:```
But what does *remean* refer to? Some kind of scaling of each value as it compares to the mean of the whole column?",U01S7KCL3DF,2.0,2.0,vanilla,6,May,Weekend,20:00,nofile,nolink_infiles,Sam Katterfield,0

"I quite like the Kaggle explanations. Been reading through a few of them this evening and they do quite a good job of putting things simply.
Two thoughts following this:
1- I think I will treat Pandas as a separate language to learn. It seems like all the functions and use of brackets are distinct from the Python rules. - and maybe on its own it is not so complex to learn (+ I guess one of the most useful for everyday stuff)
2- Within Python, I find List Comprehension (where we put loops in one line)  really tough to get my head around.",U01S133DZ9A,1.0,1.0,vanilla,2,April,Weekday,21:44,nofile,nolink,Simon Data,0
