"I feel like a slave to this dumb Resume Worded algorithm. It simply doesn't like the format I chose and i had to stick to a very lean one column CV. Imagine in the future, when much more serious decisions will be made by algorithms with serious flaws like this."
"Francisco, we have to remove the fancy/beautiful format before upload there."
"Ah, ok!"
"I just copied each session. without any table, just text. Like the examples (models) in the website"
"Yeah, I did this. It has improved, but not quiet there in the 70% mark"

"take a look in each feature you need most to improve and expand to check what you can make to improve"
"I put first as junior, later as mid. I had better score using  mid."
"Which one do we have to submit?"
"I choose when evaluating, but inside my CV I just put data analyst/researcher"
"Could you solve  the problem of the language in Linkedin?"
"No... But I reached the 70% mark regardless..."
"But many people have this problem, right? This must be a bug so expensive to solve that they prefer to leave it that way"
"I should have contacted Hang regarding this issue, but it is also my fault that I ""deixei tudo pra ultima hora"", like a good Brazilian"
"I am facing this issue. I can’t change part of the printed linked to english. I couldn’t achieve 70% in linkedin yet… boringgg"
"My trick was to put Ironhack as experience. This is what Alex did, for example: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-sommerkamp-b272766b/>"
"Resumeworded recommends you to put something that you are doing as a freelancer when you are unemployed. I think that the Ironhack experience qualifies as that because we are doing a lot of stuff for our Github and Tableau accounts, which employed people also do."
"This is ""work"""
"Like this guy puts it, it is important to constantly do work on your own interest, even if you don't make money: <https://towardsdatascience.com/why-i-stopped-applying-for-data-science-jobs-7b93b3b8153b?source=email-ee2d1c23f92a-1620531849390-digest.reader-7f60cf5620c9-7b93b3b8153b----0-73------------------a49ed00a_c54d_4a43_93e1_a79587f9f3ae-1-1f9fa6ee_568b_42d6_9a79_c2fe4f976b34|https://towardsdatascience.com/why-i-stopped-applying-for-data-science-jobs-7b93b3b8153b[…]_93e1_a79587f9f3ae-1-1f9fa6ee_568b_42d6_9a79_c2fe4f976b34>"
"ok, thanks. But I think it a bad practice… I don’t know it doesn’t recognise my bullets in experience"
"Yeah, its not ideal..."
"ahhahha each time I check it shoes a different (worse) score… even when I change nothing…"
"But i find it very hard to circumvent it otherwise. For example, I cannot add many metrics because in my work experience did this not really exist..."
"I worked in a place that did not exactly ""maximise"" stuff. It was a lobbying think thank that did not have a profit goal"
"The algorithm has its weaknesses.Knowing that there is this problem with linkedin and languages, there should be an option of manually assigning the name of sections.."
"Or Hang and the team should accept a 60% score for those cases"
"true, the resumeworded has weaknesses and also the Linkedin. I would love to delete my Portuguese version. But it doesn’t let me do it."
"I managed to achieve 71% adding something / project (vague) as a freelancer… This tool works better to CV."
"I really don’t what other keywords they want in the summary"
"Unfortunately i dont have it :("
"Yes, i cannot ""invent"" keywords and metrics"

"<!channel>,
regarding your *final projects* next week: As we announced, we're going to have *morning stand up sessions* in the morning from Monday until Thursday. These will happen in groups and Kosta, Sian and me will each mentor one stand up group. We distributed you into these groups:
• Sian: <@U01S0MFJ3HR>, <@U01S081EULS>, <@U01S65G72SY>, <@U01S6LCPM0C>, <@U01RNEU3SNA>, <@U01S6L7HLUC>, <@U01RXCQHMHT> 
• Kosta: <@U01RW2X7S9Z>, <@U01SD3CDH9P>, <@U01S1CWGTU4>, <@U01S0E0MRJ7>, <@U01RP2K1606>, <@U01RN7BVD1C>, <@U01RKN0EGDV>, <@U01S133DZ9A> 
• Flo: <@U01S7BM4N81>, <@U01RRV4JX6Z>, <@U01S0P26NKD>, <@U01S79YDELR>, <@U01SK96QF5E>, <@U01RV3K524T> / <@U01RVSTNRRT>, <@U01S7KCL3DF> 
The mentors will contact you / invite you to dedicated channels to coordinate the further meetings. Keep in mind, these are just groups for the stand up and it doesn't mean you just have to direct your questions to your ""mentor"". Of course you can still make use of the expertise of the whole teaching team and as we mentioned after the previous projects, place your questions first in the <#C0215VDBWPQ|final-project> channel, which ensures that you get help as fast as possible and by the LT/TA who is most knowledgeable (we all have our special fields of interest you might know by now :slightly_smiling_face:)"
"Are stand ups at 9 or 10? "
"I think today is normal retro at 9
The whole stand up thing, I think is from next week on."

Just had a look at it yesterday and this seems quite a lot :scream::sob:"
"Hi <@U01RN7BVD1C>, yeah i think that's right. Hang sent an email the other day reminding us of the deadline."
"I’m not that sure actually.. This is what’s in the deadline email for 11th April:
 “I suggest the below PROCESS for the CV in the following order:
Follow all suggested steps on your module Careerhack stage 1 to implement best practices for your CV structure draft &amp; LinkedIn profile - pay attention to keywords, metrics, language, etc.
Attend the CV &amp; LinkedIn workshop on Wednesday, 14th April at 6pm to get an idea of what recruiters look at &amp; how
After the workshop in week 4, activate resumeworded* premium and use their BASIC word template to optimise the content based on the tool’s feedback by using the function “Resume Targeting” which requires you to upload a job ad of your choice to get an effective scoring
Reach a score of 70 minimum and copy &amp; paste the optimised content from the resumeworded template to your final CV design
Upload the final CV design and LinkedIn URL to Careerhack on your student portal, so I can approve them via the system
(make sure the sharing option of the CV file is accessible)
Final deadline for stage 1: before the end of week 7 to give me enough time to go through your CVs. If there is anyone who wants to discuss regarding this stage, please make sure to have followed the above steps first and then book the 1:1.”"
"""Hey Francisco,

I hope you are doing well in your 2nd week :)

It is important to keep up with CareerHack, thus I want to remind you to *finish* *Stage 1* *by* the end of next week (*Sunday, 11th April*), if you are aiming to find a job after the bootcamp. 

We are going to have CV and Linkedin workshops in weeks 4 and 7 that are going to *build on top of your work!* 

Btw, I still need 2 volunteers from the Data group for 1 CV and 1 LinkedIn each, so I can review them as case studies during the workshop from a Tech Recruiting point of view."""

• 2:30 meet me back in the main zoom classroom, we will talk about how to evaluate logistic regression models, overfit and class imbalance. 
• 4pm robert will join us 
• the remainder of the day, there are a few optional labs in the Notion to keep you entertained, or you can work on tidying up your regression model to submit it on your student portal. PLEASE everyone submit a logistic regression notebook as your lab (in whatever state) today- either the iris data set or the bank A/B prediction- not just a copy of my or Flo’s notebook though, create your own version with a nice structure (we can tell if you copy+paste !)

Two things need to be done by you before or during (depeding on how quick you are with those things) Wednesday's lecture:

1. *Setup a* :spotify: *App and get the credentials*
head to <https://developer.spotify.com/> and setup an app:
1. click on DASHBOARD on the above panel
2. login in with your credentials
3. click ""create an app"", give it a name and if you want a description, tick the :tick_checkmark:, click ""create""
4. click the huge green box (left picture) for your app that was created. You should see your *Client ID* and if you click SHOW CLIENT SECRET, there's your *client secret* (right picture)*.* Especially don't share the latter with anyone / push it to github. You can revoke it though, if you accidentally did.

We need both the client id and the client secret to connect to the Spotify API and use the Spotipy wrapper.


*2.* :python:  *Install SpotiPy into your anaconda environment:*
`conda install -c conda-forge spotipy`"

"quick announcement -  tomorrow I will be ending the lunchtime lecture at 12:40 to attend a funeral virtually and my expectation is I wont be in a great state to teach you again tomorrow afternoon. This means we have just one other short lecture session tomorrow, between the morning class retro and lunch, but I will ask the TAs nicely if one of them will take you through some SQL or Python katas for some collaborative revision in the afternoon, to make up for it."

Is downloading the entire zip file the only way to get the lab files from GitHub?"
"I claim no, but some of your peers may say yes :grin:
It seems to be OS specific. I (Ubuntu 20.04) can do a right click on the ""RAW"" button in the upper right corner in github and click ""save as"" and then it saves the file in the right format. No need for a zip file for me."
"you can pull the files of the repo, but some of them might not get to your system if the names are not written in a certain way (I think whitespace and things like that wont work) at least in my windows system"

He does not cook, im afraid, Isabel… but he will prompt my aunt Leri to cook for him now he is vegan…
he loves all and any books, he will treasure whatever you come up with but one suggestion from me would be - take a photo of the whole class doing bear hugs and send it to him with an email and comments from some of you. it wont cost a thing, and he isnt really into packaging and plastic waste as you can imagine"

"Software and Hardware setup requirements for this week (unit2):
• Monday - no additional setup needed, you will be primarily working on your project - in python/ pandas/numpy. Ensure you can actively participate in your group by testing your audio/ video on zoom. If this is not possible on your laptop, try the zoom app on your phone or tablet
• Tuesday - zoom - as we have class presentations in the morning, any and all of you should be able to share your screen. Please enable/ test this, plus testing audio functionality / internet speed tests as appropriate eg <https://zoom.us/test|test zoom>, <https://www.speedtest.net/|test speed> 
• Tuesday lecture and labs - we will be using jupyter notebook with numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries. Nothing new to install but check that your chosen conda environment (if you are using conda) works with matplotlib and seaborn or use your base jupyter environment. 
• Wednesday + Thursday we all will need tableau public (minimum) or tableau desktop (optional) 2021 version. I have given you a lab for tuesday afternoon to complete this setup. I would recommending using the quickstart (same lab) to ensure your laptops can cope with tableau and zoom. Unfortunately tableau is memory hungry and there are minimum tech specs listed <https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/products/techspecs|here> - the alternative on the day will be to work on a browser version, so do let us know if you are struggling with your hardware/RAM so we can prepare for this. 
• Friday- we will return to Python and will be using numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn + <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html|sci-kit_learn> which will require an install on your chosen python env"

":arrow_up: thats the full yoga ironhack organise, we of course have Robert joining us at 4pm as normal"
"Could you also upload the Tableau workshop recording from today? :slightly_smiling_face:"
"depends when available Tony… thats kind of up to zoom"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> or <@U01RSRE0N3D> can you keep an eye out for when that recording has compiled?"
"will do. But could well be that Zoom needs until the evening"
"thats what i would expect"
"oh, I see like it takes a long time for Zoom to get it uploaded, right?"

 one of the companies actively recruiting in the UK to expand their data team, across all senior roles, is Tescos (the supermarket).

"advice on miniconda for mac... do i want bash or pkg?"
"you would want to download the pkg installer and run that one"
"also 3.8 not the 2,7 version, theres huge differences ^^"
"yes the link to github contains the solution"

"thanks flo for sorting out my blunders as always lol"
"Thanks :slightly_smiling_face: The results appear for me in this way, I cannot download the jupyter. It this the idea?"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> zip the files before attaching them - worked that out this morning"
"so they are downloaded, not rendered"
"obv  if accessing them from github theres no need"
"i “saved as” from the browser and then opened in jupyter"
"which browser? I can’t find"
"right click, save as, i guess"
"I don’t have how"
"What <@U01S0E0MRJ7> says works: Download the file, start your jupyter notebook server and open the Notebook in that Webbrowser interface that opens"
"ha, I found"
Thanks
"take a break - lets start class in 10 mins <!channel>"
"trying to get into the excondables environment, but get this message, any ideas? thx"
"can you run this: `conda --version`"
"so yeah not found, what do I need to do please"
"Guys, did anybody get this error while uploading the excel files?"
"this is in the zoom chat"
yes
"conda install -c conda-forge openpyxl"
"conda install -c anaconda openpyxl"
"yeah conda forge"
"conda install -c anaconda xlrd"
"i dont even know...conda forge or anaconda?"
"than
conda install -c conda-forge openpyxl"

"thank you guys, you are great! Will try it now:)"
"it worked:tada:"
"when cloning the class repo to keep getting the files that Sian uploads, the file shows empty and this shows up in git status, but i never deleted the files. Happens every time i clone it"
"if there is a easy turnaround please help me out :sweat_smile:"
"are you doing git pull or git clone ?"
"i cant see on the screenshot what you did before seeing this so can you summarise the steps you took ?"
"git clone"
"just cloning straight from the repo, i used to have it cloned but then that doesnt get updated"
"what is an easy way to open course work in the class git hub into Jupyter? do I need to fork it, must be careful how to phrase that"
"I would clone the repo, then you run a quick `git pull` to get the newest updates in the future"
"however, I would be careful not to push on that repo!"
"ok thxs"
"<@U01RSRE0N3D> 1. Clone the repo. Git pull for newest updates in the future.

2. Work on the local machine
3. Create my own repository and upload the files there

Would that work too?"
Yes!
"you should have the forked repo, where you can `git push` your lab solutions"
"my clone straight from it comes out empty, and if i check the status the snap i shared before shows up"
"i did do a different repo to upload the stuff but i cant just clone the one from sian"
"i knew i was missing a tiny window ! it was buried behind zoom - a message saying do you want to replace the file in that folder lol - the github repo is now updated with my last jup notebook checkpoint <https://github.com/student-IH-labs-and-stuff/BER-DAFT-MAR21/blob/main/Class%20Materials/unit1/day3/pandas%20intro%202%20with%20annotation-students-wip.ipynb|https://github.com/student-IH-labs-and-stuff/BER-DAFT-MAR21/blob/main/Class%20Mate[…]/day3/pandas%20intro%202%20with%20annotation-students-wip.ipynb>"
"so you start with
git clone (repo url)
then after i have added some new content"
"git pull"
"should update the repo remotely saved. you wont be able to push to the repo, but it sounds like you werent using git pull, just re-cloning each time, am I right?"
"yep you need to do some git pulling sir"
"git clone is downloading, git pull is refreshing"
""
"thinking about it - i would suggest doing a *git fetch* rather than git pull … then in case you save your own work in that repo folder it wont be overwritten - a bit safer"
"<!channel>,
if you finish the `Lab | Customer Analysis Round 2` you will realize that the date column contains only entries for January and February. So obviously the exercise to filter for Jan/Feb/Mar is a bit dull.

So I overwrote the month number in the csv with random integers. You can give that csv a try, if you want to have it a bit more spiced up :grin:"
"Should we then make a copy of our Jupyter Notebook with Customer Analysis Round 2 and then read marketing_customer_anlysis_x.csv there? :slightly_smiling_face:"
"no, not necessary :grin:
just if you want to play around with another dataset that is a bit more exciting with respect to the tasks.
and don't use my data for the coming Labs please, for consistency"
Oki!
thanks!
"Ok, the dataset will give you an error if you solved the lab properly. Here's why: I subsituted the month part of the values in that `effective_to_date` column randomly with values between 1 and 12. So far so logical. But then also date values with for example ""7/31/11"" got the 7 subsituted for a 2, which would make it February the 31st, which doesn't exist and since pandas datetime is smart, it will throw you an error like this (screenshot). So, better not use my data :grin:, or: *Bonus quest*: Fix my data so that for all Februaries the days are valid :nerd_face:"

"thx for the reminder"
"yeah, I tried several things and worked on it with kosta afterwards, there was an issue with the names of the excel files, they werent compatible with windows, do git would not checkout the main branch, so the folder would show empty.. he came back later to ask me to try again after changing the names and it was all working flawlessly!

Regarding the upcoming Lab `Customer Analysis Round 3` : I inspected it and reworked the instructions. Please take the same data, but take these instructions:

&gt; For this lab, we still keep using the `marketing_customer_analysis.csv` file. You can find the file in the `files_for_lab` folder.
&gt; 
&gt; *Get the data*
&gt; Use the same jupyter file from the last lab, `Customer Analysis Round 3`
&gt; 
&gt; *EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) - Complete the following tasks to explore the data:*
&gt; * Show DataFrame info.
&gt; * Describe DataFrame.
&gt; * Show a plot of the total number of `response`s broken down by response kind.
&gt; * Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by the total claim amount.~ Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind. Try a boxplot and distribution plot, for each `response` kind. For the distribution plot, try to plot both kinds of responses in one chart (you can try with seaborn's histplot, using the `hue` parameter).
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by income.~ Create similar plots like in the task before, but for `Income`
&gt; * *NEW*: Create a scatterplot between `total claim amount` and `income`. Play around with the parameters of the scatterplot (markersize? alpha?) and try to identify more features within the data just visually. You can also try different seaborn plots. Check to find suitable ones: <https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/134-how-to-avoid-overplotting-with-python>"
"Hey, so Im still not getting how to get my data from Git hub into Jupyter, clone then pull..anybody else still having problems with this? maybe a TA could walk me through it"
"I am on it"
"let me know if someone else needs help"
"* Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.

is only the response=""yes"" that count as response? or is either response=yes, no a response?"
"It actually means 'number of responses broken down 1st by response kind, 2nd by response channel'"
"So, number of responses on the y axis, response kind on the x-axis, and then the bars for the both responses again split by the sales channel"
understood!
"me too... but watching the GitHub link that Tony shared is on my to do list:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk>"
"Thanks, Kosta walked me through it, but Ill watch this too"
"The Video from <@U01RXCQHMHT> was very helpful :clap:"
"for this:

&gt; Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind.
trying to use
`sns.boxplot(x = 'Response',y = 'total_claim_amount', file1=file1)`
`plt.show()`

but I always get errors for the column names:

""Could not interpret input 'Response'"" :thinking_face:  ... did I not install Seaborn properly?"
"the `.boxplot()` doesn't have a parameter called `file1`. you must provide `data` instead, So...
```sns.boxplot(x = 'Response',y = 'total_claim_amount', data=your_dataframe)```"
"still the same when I add the name of my dataframe :confused:"
"sns.histplot(data=file, x=""Total Claim Amount"", hue=""Response"", multiple=""stack"")"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> hi Flo, this return AttributeError : module 'seaborn' has no attribute 'displot'"
""
"Do you have any idea why?"
"Yes, in the newest version of seaborn, they begin to ditch the `distplot` and start aggregating all the distribution plots under `displot()`  (missing the ""t""). `displot` is contained in seaborn version 0.11.1, so in case you get that error, you might want to open another git bash window, activate your current environment and do
```conda update seaborn```"

"It works on Python Shell"
"i think they want you to create and use a function"
"But the instruction also says or create a shell"
"*write a script"
"I dont get what'S the purpose of this exercise. During the lectures you said that Pandas/python has always ten or more ways to do some particular operation."

"A reminder <!channel> for all to upload your lab work from this week to the student portal before the end of tomorrow please. at the moment 12 students have not submitted any lab work. for any students who arent sure how to do that, please add a :rabbit: emoji below"
"its true, for interviews as data analyst or data scientist roles, you will very often be sent a test on your SQL and python skills which looks a lot like this. one of the best skills is figuring out how to work with this software!"
"So it is not true that there are ten ways to do something, as there is one that is the desired one"
"num = int(input(""Enter a number: ""))
if (num % 2) == 0:
   print(""Even"".format(num))
else:
   print(""Odd"".format(num))"
"I put this on Python, and it worked"
"So what's the point?"
"well i think you are slightly misunderstanding it… with pandas, for example, we might have a few different ways of solving a problem. but the kind of challenge on code wars is more absolute - for example todays challenge, write a function, that can handle the introduction of an integer and then provide a response if its odd or even - one of the tests will be did you write a function"
"and your solution is not a python function"
"but it also said write a script"
"define a function means getting something like :
def test_function(argument1) :
  # Do something with the code, and the argument.
  print(argument1)

# Calling the function."
"""Create a function (or write a script in Shell)"""
"oh i see where you got that from now! makes more sense …"
"I proceeded with the latter"
"if we've made multiple errors on the work do we still upload them? asking for a friend"
"ah got it… but it still isnt a shell function right?"
"Well, I'm new to this. Is what i wrote a script?"
"oh no its not - its a logical argument i believe.
maybe im misunderstanding, but i imagine if you had the full shell script it would have passed the tests.
But as flo said, you can also see what kind of tests are being pushed on your code… like are decimals being introduced, or 0s - whatever kind os stretch test to ensure the code is good."
"this is a bit of info about shell scripting <https://www.shellscript.sh/functions.html>"
"and this about building functions in python <https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp>"
"these might help! but also know we will do much more of this in class through the course"
"soon it will feel more familiar :slightly_smiling_face:"
"and there are still a few ways of doing the same thing - dont worry! if you look at the solutions on code wars you will see things like
```def even_or_odd(number):
    return 'Odd' if number % 2 else 'Even'```
and
```def even_or_odd(number):
  if number % 2 == 0:
    return ""Even""
  else:
    return ""Odd""```
which return the same output but are structured differently!
• one thing to remember is you wont see a lot of print() on code wars as successful solutions - a little tip :wink:"
"yes i think thats the best approach actually"
"you can always update the notebooks in github later, but for now, it means we can have a look at how youre getting on and where those errors are coming up"
"What is the purpose of functions in Data Analytics? To test models, for example?"
"A linear regression?"
"ooh good question…. functions are effectively used to do tasks either repeatedly or robustly (applying rules, arguments, transformations)… you may remember in class that we wrote a clean function to tidy up the gender column, but theres a tonne of ways we could use a function in a data analysis process, from cleaning, through EDA, to predictive modelling. heres a cool example of a function you can use right now
def histograms_numeric_columns(df, numerical_columns):
    ‘’'
    Takes df, numerical columns as list
    Returns a grid of histograms
    ‘’'
    f = pd.melt(df, value_vars=numerical_columns)
    g = sns.FacetGrid(f, col=‘variable’,  col_wrap=4, sharex=False, sharey=False)
    g = g.map(sns.distplot, ‘value’)
    return g
….this is a time saver function…. instead of making a bunch of separate histograms, return all your columns as a grid of histograms. we can look at this in the morning if you like ?"
"a linear regression is a model, rather than a function, and we will start using them next friday :slightly_smiling_face:"
"ok, Sian already answered while I was typing. :grin:

The function serves the purpose to be able to ""atomize"" tasks. (Not only) in data analytics, we're facing the problem to be just overwhelmed by the task in front of us. So the general approach is: break the task into smaller tasks, which then get broken down again into smaller tasks etc.... and for the lowest ones, you would write a function, solve that problem, and then go one level up, reusing that function and solve the problem on the next higher difficulty level (related to _First Principles thinking_ I guess).

In practical terms, when it comes to code, this has the advantange that your code is - as Sian said -
• *scalable* (you don't need to reinvent the wheel at higher levels),
• your code is *reusable* for yourself and others,
• your code is *outsourcable* when you put it in functions*,* out of a notebook for example, to keep your Notebook clear and reduced to only the things you want to show (most of the time, it's the results). You would then import it as we import e.g. pandas right now, `from my_module import my_function` (we can have a workshop on that)
•  it's *robust.* if one function fails to do the job, it may break, but the rest of the code may continue running. You can even implement Error handling in exactly that function to get information in case of an error, why it failed (comes later in the bootcamp, crucial for example in _Webscraping_)
• it's easier to maintain / repair / upgrade. Dependencies are much easier to handle etc.
• Personal feeling: It feels nicer in my head to solve a problem piece by piece
Of course, all of this is merely theoretical at this point but as tasks become more and more complex, you're starting to whish for functions :slightly_smiling_face:"

"For me the course until now has been a combination of completely easy stuff with other things that I still fail to grasp"

```def get_gdp(c, i, g, t, x, m):
  y = c + i + (g - t) - (x - m)
  return y```
they also just mimic the concept of functions in math as a relation between two sets (elements of set X are associated with exactly one element of set Y). With the difference in programming being that functions can perform so much more that just project from one set to another"

"<!channel> Hey everyone :slightly_smiling_face:

I just wanted to reach out to you again about the mystery room event on Friday, if you havent already filled out the survey, please do so today to let me know if you are interested in joining the event. Please let me know before 3 PM today so I can book out the rooms :)

_""We here at Ironhack would like to invite all our students to a special online exit room event next Friday at 19.00._
_This is a great way to get in contact with students from other courses._
_During the event you will be split into small group and through the use of a camera you will steer a real life gamester through a series off puzzles. We did this event last bootcamp and it was alot of fun, some students had to protect the world against a deadly zombie virus while others had to defuse an atomic bom!!_
_If this sounds like something you would be interested in please let us know by filling out this <https://ironhack-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1lXsSGMtJ2C_SRHOCRp9C47W8sjM-aaI6CM0TUwUmV44-286680014&amp;key=YAMMID-04245215&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fironhack.typeform.com%2Fto%2FMbnfwBkS|survey>.""_

I see that a lot of modules (so we call them that?) dont have specific times attached... is that because the order can change throughout the day?

what's the prioritization? 1 is most important and 10 least important?"

*Hang*  [09:17]
Hey @sian d, thanks for raising it! I gave them 2 deadlines.

• Sunday, week 3 - Having applied all suggestions from Careerhack  stage 1 on their linkedin &amp; CV (without activating the optimisation tool, resumeworded)
• Sunday, week 7 - Having optimised their linkedin &amp; CV WITH resumeworded to a score of at least 70
[09:19] the reason why i split this is because they only have a 60 premium access to resumeworded, which I want them to activate in the 2nd half of their bootcamp.

So after the deadline week 3, I am doing a workshop in week 4 on wednesday evening to already give them an understanding what recruiters look out for. Weeks 4-7 are more for optimisation because that’s also when the bootcamp starts getting busier.
[09:21] let me know if this is clear, I do understand that this staged process can be a bit confusing - will make it clearer for the next bootcamp."

 :microscope: *regarding the today's labs (after lecture/lunch)*
please stick to these ""improved"" instructions (and not the ones you find under the github link):

• *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.5*
1. Select all the actors with the first name ‘Scarlett’.
2. How many films (movies) are available for rent and how many films have been rented?
3. What are the shortest and longest movie duration? Return the results as columns with the names  `max_duration` and `min_duration`.
4. What's the average movie duration expressed in format (hours, minutes) Return the result as columns with the names `hours` and `minutes`?
5. How many distinct (different) actors' last names are there?
6. Since how many days has the company been operating (check the `DATEDIFF()` function)? Hint: rental table
7. Show all rental information with additional columns `month` and `weekday`. (hint: `DATE_FORMAT()` ). Get 20 results.
8. Add an additional column `day_type` with values _'weekend'_ and _'workday'_ depending on the rental day of the week.
9. How many rentals were made in the last month of renting activity?
.... stay tuned, improved instructions for the other labs will maybe follow"
"<!channel>,
:microscope: for *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.6*
please use these instructions

1. Get the unique release years.
2. Get all films with _ARMAGEDDON_ in the title.
3. Get all films which title ends with _APOLLO_.
4. Get 10 the longest films.
5. How many films include *Behind the Scenes* content?
6. Drop column `picture` from `staff`.
7. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.
8. Add a rental for movie ""Academy Dinosaur"" by the customer ""Charlotte Hunter"" from employee Mike Hillyer at Store 1. You can use current date for the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table. *Hint*: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there. You can query those pieces of information in other tables. For eg., you would notice that you need `customer_id` information as well. To get that you can use the following query: 
```select customer_id from sakila.customer
where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER';```
Use similar method to get `inventory_id`, `film_id`, and `staff_id`.

9. *(Optional, you can skip this)* Delete non-active users, but first, create a _backup table_ `deleted_users` to store `customer_id`, `email`, and the `date` (use `CURDATE()` , <https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_curdate.asp|link>) for the users that would be deleted. Follow these steps:
    ◦ Check if there are any non-active users
    ◦ Create a table _`backup table`_ as suggested
    ◦ Insert the non active users in the table _`backup table`_
    ◦ Delete the non active users from the table _`customer`_"

"Hi, if someone needs xls-files from statista (<https://www.statista.com/>). I can try to download this for you. I have access to statista about my library-account  at <http://www.voebb.de|www.voebb.de>. I only found out that today."
"Hi, Anya. Cool. I will check the list of datasets to choose some"
"Yes of course.. I find a lot of lists in Statista by using <https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/>"
"you have access to these statistica data from the library…super, I didn’t know."
"I did not renew my account"
"Yes I have a library ccount at Landes- und Zentralbibliothek. And this library is member of the <http://www.voebb.de|www.voebb.de> (group of all public libraries in Berlin). And about this, I have access to Statista."

"A panel should be configured in the following way:"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> typed some feedback in the chat of zoom for every group that presented on friday, but i dont know if everyone saw it so I am attaching the chat log.  If any group wants more detailed feedback on a particular part of their code, their approach or technique, let us know on this thread with detailed questions so we can give you specifically the help/guidance you want."

"excellent lab submission rate for today! I have 15 submitted now, only 1 with a broken link and 1 looks incomplete. I have just been through them all using the handy <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/> - looking to see if all prescribed steps are there, ill share some feedback in the morning on that (very light touch feedback, so im not up all night )

those students who havent yet submitted, please do so asap tomorrow morning, so you dont fall behind this week - submit the lab as far as you have it, it does not need to be completed to the end of the task list.

FYI tomorrows lab is very short but we will do more together in class, to mix it up a bit"

"As one of our follow up actions from yesterdays poll :

• for this weeks GNOD project - I have put a very simple minimum viable product together in jupyter notebook which takes a user input (song name) and compares it to the top 100 to provide a song recommendation. This is for the first product image (shown in the notebook) and can be adapted to the names / columns of your own top 100 variables.
• in addition, this could, of course, be extended for the second version of the product (the spotipy songs+ features, kaggle database, unsupervised clustering) , and can be added to by modularising the scraping code, recommender function, spotipy code etc 
i will be available in a breakout room later this afternoon for a q&amp;a on how to use this template."
"<@U01RW140HBP> could I get your opinion? I’m quite behind on everything…

I was thinking of going back over previous days/notebooks, get something atleast functional… then coming back to the unsupervised ML lectures later (maybe tonight)? Would that be an idea?"

because usually that option is possible"

"staphney is your middle name? so pretty!

I love the background colour and all the white space you’ve chosen to go for  - i think it makes it look nice and clean. Also you have gone for very minimal labels - its a style i haven’t seen before---im not 100% with you :slightly_smiling_face: , but i like the way you have executed that. Good choice of simple colour scheme, not overwhelming.
• it would be nice if the profit filter controlled the other charts too - so we saw the top customer list and category view change. 
• also it would be nice if the category filter controlled more than one chart
• the lollipop chart needs a little work - looks to me, when furniture is selected, as if the axes arent snyc’d anymore, as the circle  is somehow offset from the bar (not a problem on office supplies), but also the bars and circles could be adjusted to align better. Typically the top of the lollipop is bigger than the width of the bar.
• check your map- in line with my rule of users will do anything you dont want them to, i could zoom out on the map - I normally turn off that zoom or switch to pan mode when publishing a map
• i really like that the map filters the other charts - but you could edit those tooltips to make them look nicer / be more relevant "
"<@U01SD3CDH9P> just to check youre in this channel?"
"well done Federico! I am sorry to hear your laptop is not coping with Tableau, can you try updating to the latest version of tableau public to ensure you havent got a buggy version ?
a good overall structure, but it doesnt resolve too well on my monitor - have you got it set on automatic size or did you build it on a big screen? maybe test it on your laptop and see how it looks"
"Appreciate the feedbacks Sian, I'm going to work on these :)"
"ill add more feedback when youre in groups today :slightly_smiling_face:"
"Yes, I am! Should I add the dashboard here too?"
"please :slightly_smiling_face:"
"for peer feedback this is the place"
<https://fivethirtyeight.com/>
"its a bit visually busy - one way you make it less so is working on removing and labels, particularly axis labels that are unnecessary to the story. sometimes you can get away with a good tooltip and remove the axis altogether.
Good job with the floating legends and filters though, plus i quite like the bottom left bar chart labels."
"i think it would be better if the charts were interactively linked, as at the moment they are just placed… something to work on for the future"
"and it is pretty. I like that you used floating legends and filters to make better use of the space, that you chose a title which is a ‘call to action’ - encouraging people to dive in and explore the data themselves.
I agree with the colours - be careful that people dont assume the same shade of purple means the same thing in two places but nice use of colour background and outlines - if im being fussy the boxes are not quite aligned here"
"but overall good job! this dashboard is not overwhelming :slightly_smiling_face:
Maybe something to work on is the interaction between the charts"
"I agree with Thamo, nice idea to show the lapsed customers in a staggered kind of bar chart :slightly_smiling_face: i would consider the placement of your two colour legends on the right… i feel like you dont need the legend for RFM rc tier as you have the headers in the chart itself. The other legend (the customer segments) you could show the names of the segments in the bar chart and lose that legend too, or float it, in the white space above the big yellow bar.
In general its a good idea to avoid axis which make us have to turn our heads sideways :owl:- theres one axis label doing that now, on your rfm rc tier bar chart.
nice job on the comments - try making that font bold and a bit bigger?
agree with Marian -  put white font on the grey header blocks- i would even add a matching grey outline to the charts to hold it all together
overall - great job!"
"really nice layout Olubunmi! i like the consistent use of colours bar chart to line chart - as a consequence i would avoid using blue again on the map, to save any visual confusion. good size font for the titles, its clear and easy to use.
consider changing the filters from multi select drop down to single button select - this avoids anyone unticking all options and ending up with nothing to look at! We can talk about different options for placing your filters… the truth is they can go anywhere!"
"stepping up with a movie version! nice one :slightly_smiling_face:
i like that youve used a srong, bold font for your titles and considered sizing for an intuitive layout. Its a nice layout too, very logical, and i like the colours.
you seem to have an issue in the filters top right - they are too squashed, so maybe go back and give it more space when you can"
"its great that your region filter affects everything, but the date filter only changes the map, which could be a bit confusing because thats not near the map, its at the top of the dashboard - i would expect it to filter everything.
nice use of a floating legend for the map. when publishing a map its a good idea to turn the zoom functionality off so your end users dont end up really zoomed out"
"not quite the dashboard lab we were working on but ok!
without legends on the scatter plots having the multiple trend lines are hard to interpret - can you think about adding legends , having just one trend line , and instead of lots of small coloured circles which clash with the trend line, you could potentially eliminate all the extra colours or have one grey trend line. Once a scatter plot gets visually busy its worth switching from shape to circles, which can be faded, and show the density better with an outline, so I would have  think about that.
nice use of the bold blue headings - watch out for the _condition of property_ axis, its quite squeezed and the label doesnt fully display on my laptop- in fact you can drop the axis labels i think as each scatter contains the same information on x and y"
"hi thanks for the feedback, I will review my dashboard, I used this data so Id complete my project file"
"yeah I agree with Neil you might want to turn the zoom control off :slightly_smiling_face: we are too used to google maps arent we :slightly_smiling_face:
i like the floating layout, making best use of your space. I would drop the grid lines from the bar charts to keep the whole look clean, or do the same as you did with the lollipop chart - looks like they are really faded out.
Did you consider creating a dashboard title ? it feels sort of lost without it.

the profit legend could go further up the map, nearer to the view title, the category legend is possible unnecessary - something to be careful of - that legend is placed next to california at the moment, which also is blue - suggesting california is furniture, so consider your colour choices.

with so much space going for the  map i think you need to have more information on your tooltip, maybe a viz in tooltip ? but certainly clean the tooltips up a bit!"
"nice, simple three part grid structure - i think it would look neater if you had turned off the grid lines, put a title on the dashboard to bring it all together. I would recommend you to revise and test your dashboard actions … i dont think this is what you wanted to happen"
"Thank you Sian! I will work on it! :slightly_smiling_face:"

<https://public.tableau.com/profile/sam.katterfield#!/vizhome/recyclingandbeer/RecyclingBeer>

I too was messing with that London recycling set… on the <https://data-ft-ber-03-2021.slack.com/archives/C01SAEL4UKF/p1619686877001500|thread above> there was talk of adding bars on each borough…but…. i cant figure it out. ‘Bars’ gives me HUGE bars on each borough (all the same height and just varying by width….not ideal)… Gantt chart gives me teeny tiny bars of the same(ish) size.

Which formatting option am I not seeing?"
"yes colour and layout are not ideal…started getting too creative with backgrounds…. and the beer prices were in pence, took me a while to get them into pounds with the right symbol :neutral_face:"
"uhhh i LOVE the bier icon!!!"
"but yes the bars look very funny that way, like a raining cloud. Would be interesting to know how to change that scale."
"<@U01RN7BVD1C> i’m having doubts over the data quality….cant remember a London beer ever being that cheap :thinking_face:

unless the figures are taken from a <https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0&amp;err=1&amp;mid=1m12qzR7wcMI9JC8PzL0PzxMBay0|Sam Smiths pub>"
"hahaha yeah thats quite cheap, nearly berlin euro prices hmm"
<@U01RW140HBP>
"wow ! quite the bar chart over map combo lol
so what I can see quickly is that although you have Year in your beer data, I cant see any evidence you have london borough, in your beer data - hence the price of beer would be the same for all parts of london - is that what you expected ?  price ranges from 2.26 in 2003/4 to 3.70 in 2019/20, which does feel cheap for london!

as to your visualisation, you are using the size of bars, over the top of the map - but this is duplicated encoding, because you have created a copy of latitude, then changed the display of latitude to bars, even though its just displaying the same information as on the original map.
what are you trying to show on the map ? because if i strip the bars away we just have a map and beer, then it makes sense"
""
"and well done for getting the beer icon in there and making the beer grow over time… i think if you could get an average price by borough (no idea where from) or a london beer price (i think this must be nationwide) then this would be great stuff!"
"oops…. yes… now I see the beer prices are from the ONS, so will be nationwide:

<https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/czms/mm23|https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/czms/mm23>

per borough would be fun, but a challenge :joy: …having it just for london was the plan

I'm just trying to show some bars on each borough…. shorter ones for lower numbers, taller ones for higher numbers…mainly for the lolz

using latitude twice came from here… but their bars on the US map example look sensible :thinking_face:

"Not gonna lie, plotly is a powerful library"
"its a cool tool… but curious to find out, what did you learn from the plot?"
"I was interested in the relationship of  grade and condition, and how it relates to price.
Interesting to see here:
• low prices come in all conditions and grades (referring to sub 200k)
• High prices usually have a condition of 3+ AND a grade of 4+
• There’s no high grade-low condition-cluster (I assumed this, and it is true)
• Very high condition and very high grade correlate to higher prices, but are likely not the cause of them"
"Surely, you can gather these insights from basic scatterplots as well, but it was a fun experience to “walk” through the data and look at the clusters individually"
"It’s the only 3D scatterplot I explored, since it is harder to consume than normal scatterplots - also a learning from that one :slightly_smiling_face:"
"agree, its really helpful sometimes to see day from a different angle - in this case literally. and it can help with those relationships that are hard to plot, because they are multidimensional, so its very useful to get your thoughts on how easy it was to confirm those insights from plotly"

"i love the comments and insights Karina! and the colour scheme is also very pleasing. I think its a bit of a busy dashboard, particularly because the box plots are a little visually busy - but its really well constructed and the questions are all great

things i would consider changing - i dont think you need the category legend because we can see it in the top left chart - removing that legend would eliminate the whitespace. and do you need the axis labels and scales on the box plots ? i think that could be dropped too"

"there are a lot of colours on here- maybe rethink how many colours you want to include in one dashboard - you could use a viz in tooltip or a drill down dashboard instead  - plus, using purple in the header as well as in the rfm segmention ‘lapsed valuable’ could be misinterpreted as purple means x…"
"i like the instructions though and the layout feels quite untuitive, just busy. one way to make it less busy - remove any unnecessary axis labels and titles"
"thank you!!"
welcome!
"fire! theres a fire! good work Francisco. this dashboard is really quite sophisticated in the insights and visually balanced - youve done a good chunk of statistical analysis here and dug into the why, of what makes westminster an outlier. I like the colour scheme (goes well with the fire theme) though i would think about a different colour for the scatter plot- maybe a brown, so it stands out but not too much. also a great use of a polynomial trend line! i hadnt spotted that :slightly_smiling_face:
some tips - i think you could get away without the label ‘borough name’ at least on one of the charts - because its quite intuitive. the chart on the bottom right - i feel like you need a better header that doesnt run out of space.  - maybe something short like ‘popln / borough’
everything else is tidy, but rather than being an interactive dashboard its more of a infographic, because youve answered the questions. It would have been nice to see some interactive pieces with an end user in mind"
"You did a good job. I would remove the stacked columns in the middle (or place them elsewhere,, if they are important) and patternize the colors..."
"and one little fussy  english thing - i think i would prefer “the darker the colour…” rather than “the redder …”  but these are tiny points, i think youve done a great job"

"as a reminder, here is what you need to have prepared"
Welcome!
"i did say a 1 minute pitch, kosta"
"was gonna say….5 minutes is a big elevator :smile:

random looks very alphabetical haha"
"one of those skyscrapers in dubai ?"
"please stand by
<https://youtu.be/VBlFHuCzPgY>"
"for the first time ever i'm called top of a list that's arranged alphabetically, my surname starts with S :'("
"There is something I'm still struggling to understand with multiclass classification (or with classification problems in general). The output array, which is actually a quiet large one, is a list of likely predictions. It is used to construct the classification model's metrics. Correct? is there a hierarchy between those values? In the sense that the first value of the array is the more likely one?"
"I feel you Alex, I’m also usually the last :smile:"
"probably more a question for <#C01S58JN5FT|lab-help>. But anyway...
Yeah, mostly correct. Although there's no hierarchy.

The output (let it be `y_predict` ) is an array with values of the different ""classes"" (like the four flower species in the iris dataset). It is of equal length as the feature dataframe (let it be `X_test` ) which you put in the model to predict them. The metrics for classification (<https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-classification-evaluation-metrics-you-must-know-aa97784ff226|True negatives, True positives, False negatives, False positives, accuracy score, F1 error, F2 error, accuracy, precision, recall>, ... ) are then calculated (or directly observable in the confusion matrix) by comparing `y_predict` with `y_test` . The latter is the _Truth,_ the first is the _predicted._ One basically looks for every pair of `y_predic` and `y_test` , how many are there of each combination? And then the confusion matrix is nothing but a tally chart of those possible combinations of the two arrays and in a best case scenario you only have matching pairs, which results in the fact that TN's and TP's are maximized.

So, to answer your last question: No, the order of the predicted label array `y_predicted` doesn't contain any hierarchy. It's just what your model has predicted for every corresponding line of your input dataframe"
"Thanks! No, its not for the lab..."
"I'm trying to understand this for the final project"
"That explanation was on point... I needed to understand where the number of output points came from... Thanks again!"

"Hi guys, I am trying to iterate though dates without success. My goal is to send one request to this api to get data foe each day in a range of time but I am getting and error. Can you see what I am doing wrong? Thank you:slightly_smiling_face:"
"Hey guys, maybe someone is free now, so I’ll give it a try: I’m trying to concat df’s from which some doesn’t have the same amount of columns as the other one, but most of their columns will match (the values will be different, so I need them to be copied one below each other). I want to fill in the columns which some of them lack with NaN values in the result df. I tried every parameter, none of them returns what I need. :disappointed:

• do this after setting the column names consistently across the frames. 
• get it right for two data frames before trying multiple data frames in one go 
happy to join you if alex cant help, but im sure he can"
"Hey Lilla. Looks like you got a solution - this sounds like a similar issue that was doing my head in all weekend :see_no_evil:.
If you are struggling maybe consider joining the  JSON files first (then to DataFrame afterwards). This is how I did it - but it wasn't pretty"
"Thanks both! Solved it with Alex, it was an outer join with index set to False - what I did already but to test I was checking the .head instead of .shape. Maybe more coffee will do  :sweat_smile:"

"if you want to iterate over a dataframe i suggest using df.iterrows() instead"
"what do you want to get in the end?"
"for the length of df.fruits_veggies i want to get the results 1 or 2 or 3 saved in body_score"
"ah ok it is wrong…this is probably adding to body score all the time :see_no_evil: but i want  a list"
"```for index, row in df.iterrows():
    if row[index of your fruit_veggies column] &lt; 2:
         do this```"
"and you probably want to append to the list and not sum it up :slightly_smiling_face:"
"you can use directly the column going for fruit in df['fruits_veggies']:
if fruit &lt;2:
and so on"
"like you dont need to user range len df if you iterate directly on the column"
"lol i’ve been iterrowing this whole time, thanks alex!
His solution is most likely quicker"
"i guess iterrows is good and faster if you need to operate on several columns for each operation, i haven't used it yet"

"<@U01RW140HBP> is there a way to use max as window function without partition? I was experimenting and trying to filter results where return_date is equal to max return_date. something like:
 select *,
from sakila.RENTAL;
where EXTRACT(MONTH FROM return_date) = max ( EXTRACT(MONTH FROM return_date))"
"i would do this with a self join… hold that thought"
"so the challenge you have here is you cant use the window function as part of the where clause due to the order of execution … they are created in the Select, so cant also be used in Select:
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
this gets you half of the way there… in real life I would normally run the query *select max(return_date) from rental* first, spot that the max month is 9 and then just hard code 9 into my code :
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) = 9* 
…. however to do it programmatically, rather than manually, involves either a subquery or a self join - subquery would be the better way to go.
*select * , month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) =* 
*( select month(max(return_date))  from rental)*
here the subquery is the same as i started with …

a self join method is actually too messy (i tried a few versions) !"
"try using use sakila ;
then your INSERT INTO statement. But i think you will find there are some constraints on the table which require inserting more information than you have here. if you check the create statement for this table you will see we cant have null entries for
*first name* 
*last name* 
*address id* 
*store id* 
*user name.*
what this means is you will get an error if you try to partially fill a record not completing all those cells.
to get all that information, because we know Tammy is already a customer, you can query her records
*SELECT * FROM sakila.customer*
*where first_name = ‘Tammy’*
then you can amend your insert into statement to include that info
*insert into sakila.staff(first_name, last_name,  address_id, store_id, username)*
*values(‘TAMMY’,‘SANDERS’, 79, 2, ‘tammy’)*
if this doesnt make sense lets jump in a breakout room and go through it later!
*actually the user name is made up…. ‘tammy’ which is not obvious* "
"where is often easier ! and you can combine where with a subquery (we will go through this in tomorrows lecture) so that is flexible. However i normally use joins where i want fields from more than one table."
"if your database is clean, all tables have good referential integrity (ie no missing actor_id), it doesnt matter … in general i suggest to start a join with the transactional table but we dont really have transactions in this join between actors and the bridge table, so it could be done either way."
"select count(distinct actor_id) from film_actor

"if anyone needs some inspiration :arrow_up:"
"The data is across a whole year. Not just for March to June 2020. - oder?"
"i believe the data should be a whole year - they just havent updated the description text re dates (no comment)"
:+1:
"looks to me that it is updated daily. the baseline, as i said, is generally from feb 2020 but i cant promise thats the case for all countries /regions"
"for example this is albania - how many facebook users stayed put mar 20 to apr 21 (i think its a %) and the baseline is all of february, when they had data to the day of the week granularity for albania."
"my tableau is really slowwwww I have to wait like 1 minute for changing btw sheets :destroy:and I already filtered the countries before, any tips? or just patience haha"
"did you do a country and a date filter at the data source page to reduce the amount of data you have ?
its a big data source… you could also publish it to tableau public, and edit it in the cloud, taking the pressure off your RAM"
"filtering at ds by year, month, country"
"this filters to 2500 rows. i think the polygons are consuming alot of ram… if you arent going to use them (ie just want to do time series) you could also hide those columns"
"thank you!!"
"each request processing takes long time on my tableau as well. elapsed time around 3 -4 mins :sob:"
"same tips as above"
"also close down any other programs that might be using ram"
"its a good laptop test !"
"yes, doing it right now! :slightly_smiling_face:"
"<@U01RW140HBP> do you know how can we show a country’s and one of it’s cities (timeline) on the same worksheet?"
"yes - something like this :"
"a couple of parts to it… create an LOD calculation which picks up the avg /med movement change by date only (ignores polygon name, along with any other dimension)"
"this gives you the country - include the country field if you have multiple countries in your data set"
""
"and second part, is create an IF calculation based on the polygon name for your chosen city. I am working with albania, heres the calc for tirana… it effectively says only include the relative change information IF place is tirana"
"then you can plot them on a combined axis to spot the differences"
"does this make sense or shall i pop into your break out room to go through it on screen with you"
"no I think it makes sense! thank you :slightly_smiling_face:"
"POLYGONS! you might know i like a good map… you can, if you like, go <https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html|here> to download polygons for the country/ regions you are looking at  - do a spatial join and then plot the changes over time for a marked contrast. eg"
"if anyone wants help working with polygons let me know i can jump in your room"
"great stuff!"

"on my way"
"can you please also us in room 1 after Preby?"
"and to our room as well, room 2:)"
"yes on my way to 1 then 2"
"<@U01RW140HBP> we are also pretty lost in room number 9. Could you please help us?"
"Baseline question. If I look at one day in a week - a Sunday in July on the tiles visited measure. Is it a comparison with an average Sunday in Feb?"
"how can we put the date as a timeline filter, but binning weekly?"
"it is indeed (as long as the baseline type is DAY_OF_WEEK) - some of the countries have a less detailed baseline, like average / end of month / first day of month"
"great question. add the Ds to filters as a blue filter, using the More option on the date menu to find week number"
"want me to pop across and show you on your screen?"
"with a blue filter you can set it to show as a slider, without the ALL button like this"
"i also added a filter to only saturday, so i can compare movement  on the weekend only, and include the full date of each saturday on the title"
"but that part is optional!"
Thanks
"might be helpful to know how big the bing tiles are - normally the small unit of change captured is 4km square or so …"
"so you dont see if someone moved around in their house or street, but you can see if they go for a walk more than 30 mins and if they took a bus or made a car journey"
"i take it back - they are using level 16 bing tiles, which is 0.6km sq, so actually it should capture a 20 min walk :slightly_smiling_face:"
"a clarification of what those movement stats mean : The <https://dataforgood.fb.com/|Facebook Data for Good program> has released four new datasets pertaining to mobility:
• *<https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/movement-range-maps/|Movement Range>* comprises two metrics: <https://research.fb.com/blog/2020/06/protecting-privacy-in-facebook-mobility-data-during-the-covid-19-response/|Change in Movement and Stay Put>. The Change in Movement metric is an estimate of the number of the people who are “moving”, i.e., the average number of level 16 <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system|Bing tiles> (0.6km by 0.6km) that a user was present in during an entire day versus a pre-pandemic baseline. The Stay Put metric estimates the opposite – the number of people who are staying home, i.e., percent of users that were present in only one level 16 Bing tile for at least 3 different hours on a given day."
"but then if i say with week number, it wont start in march 2020 and finish may 2021 right?"

"are you on tableau desktop?"
yes
"i can't find the extract data in the data menu"
"uhoh :open_mouth:"
"not there?"
"it will - well spotted… i only have one year in my view…
ok, so in this case you can drag the DS as a filter, choose range of dates, then select week number (keeping it green)
finally change the data type from continuous to discrete (now it goes blue)
this will give you the chance to move between weeks based on their full start date, and will cover both the years

theres a few steps, the final output looks like this"

"you can try to iterate to see if it works:
{key:value for key,value in zip(owner,id)}"

"but wait the issue there is that your keys are not unique, you have to flip them around"

"as you said the films are rented multiple times- because the query includes rental dates, there will be multiple copies of inventory id returned in the results. to group up to the inventory id level you must use a group by + aggregation. try aggregating using MAX  or MIN rental date - whatever makes more sense for your query, and group by inventory_id"

okydoky!
"so a granular histogram is just counting the unique values… you would only see a count of more than 1 (ie a bar above average length) where the same exact value was replicated across multiple cities. I wonder if thats likely in this data set ?
most of the time in the histograms created in python you are systematically ‘binning’ the data points, as in grouping up the values into buckets, so you should see a bar in your histogram which covers similar values, ie the first bar might account for  all the values between 50 and 58, and the next bar would be all values between 58 and 66 .. try experimenting with the bin size as this might help it make more visual sense to you

Try accessing the list by index `beautifulsoup.select('selector)[0].text`

"i understand the confusion !

if you want to hop on a breakout room and talk it through let me know.
One way to think about averages/counts:
if i do a *select count(column) from table* - i will get one value back - think of *select count(student_name) from bootcamp* - the answer is 23.
same rule applies with *select avg(age) from bootcamp* - the answer is probably around 26
if i want to see more than one row i need to do a group by on each column that isn’t the value aggregated
*- select count(student_name), gender from bootcamp* 
*group by gender* 
would return male : 15 , female:8

I always start with joining the tables i need, select all the fields i want to use across the tables, then think about doing the aggregation using count/avg + groupby

However for qu 6 you are right that we can use one table, transactionhistory, because it has transaction ids and the date-- the challenge here is to extract the month and year for our group by."

say theres a numerical column in my dataframe. In that one column, I want to replace several different integers (lets call them 1,2,3,4,5) with just one integer (let’s say 9).

whats the best way to do that? with a list?"
"you want to change specifics or all of them?"
"all of them that are in a certain range"
"Well the whole column will end up replaced... Just different ranges will become different new values"
"can you use an IF ELIF ELSE statement? to replace the values with your choices …"

if n==1:
return 9
elif n==2:
return 10
else:

"What <@U01S7BM4N81> says :slightly_smiling_face:

You have to either overwrite `file3` with the output of that or use the `inplace=True` switch. Otherwise your changes won't be permanent. You just get an output shown, but no changes are made on the dataframe itself. So do something like

```file3 = file3.rename(columns={ 'state':'ST'})```
or
```file3.rename(columns={ 'state':'ST'}, inplace=True)```
I personally prefer the first solution, since not all pandas functions have an `inplace` parameter. And I'm too lazy to memorize which have, and which don't :grin:"
"Nope - I tried both those approaches :thinking_face:"
"can you provide a screenshot? maybe also show `file3.head()` and `file3.columns`"

"so I saw that one of the requirements is to delete education and number of complaints columns in the lab and I did as asked but I don’t see that done in the solutions (and I’m not sure if they should be deleted, don’t we need them at all later?). should I delete those or just clean them?"
"ah! case sensitive. your `State` has a capital S"
"u should drop them in the final concatenated file, but not delete them in the original one.
We used `data = data.drop(['number_of_open_complaints'],axis=1)`
to achieve this"
"No way :laughing:"

"pah - this should always be my first thing to check !"
thanks!
"case sensitivity annoyed me yesterday as well ^^"
"Yep - its so easy to miss it"
"Yes, I didn't do that in my solutions. But the official ironhack solutions have that (see that there are two notebook files). I instead chose to clean the `number of complaints` column and turn for example those `1/1/0` values into `1` ....
In case of doubt, follow the official Ironhack solutions, because the dataframes you get there at the end, are important for the next Lab. I just didn't see a reason why to drop `education` and `number of complaints`
 :slightly_smiling_face:

But then don't worry. The labs for this week are presented to you in a way that you always get the data with them as they should be processed up to this stage. So, if you couldn't follow with the previous Labs, you can just import the current csv's for that current Lab and work from there."

"Hi, folks. I have questions about Git/GitHub. <@U01SJKB2MG8> <@U01RW140HBP> <@U01RSRE0N3D>

• How can I edit the message of commits?"
"when modelling, how should we choose the value of `test_size` in sklearn? (`random_state` as I understand is just a random number, or?)"
"random state is the base for a randomly generated number, it is there to ensure consitency if I recall correctly.
regarding test_size, we went with 0.7 for testing and 0.3 for predicting, but our model isn’t the most precise"
"you recall correctly… so if you want to compare iterations <@U01RKN0EGDV> you should always use the same random_state (i generally use 40… theres no reason for it i just chose it early on, 100 is the one you often see)"
"the size of the train test split is kind of up to you. worth experimenting with a larger train set to see what impact it is… but to avoid overfitting to the train i normally choose a 60/40 or 70/30 split"
"so then we should have the same random_state in our iterations, but the test_size we can play with it, right?"
exactly!
"just to ensure the data is splitting randomly according to the same system, we keep the random state number the same, then the results are comparable. changing the split is independent of that, the results remain comparable"
"should there be a predict_size or is that calculated from what you put as test_size?"
"i think is calculated, 1- test_size, so just enter test_size"
"the predict size is related to the test size <@U01S7KCL3DF> --- if i have 1000 rows in my test data set (X_test) with n columns, then y_test will be also 1000 rows (one column) and the predictions will be 1000 rows long, one predicted value for each X_test row."

Although pandas builds heavily on numpy, meaning it benefits from that, there are certain ways you can use their API in which you accidentally loose this speed advantage... maybe with that `apply()` you have found one"
"Due to that reason, sometimes you see notebooks in which programmers try to use numpy as long as they can (to generate features for example), and only use pandas if they really have to - especially when it's about calculating with big datasets"

We should compare the audio features of the input song with the ones in the df of the songs audio feautres we got yesterday and recommend another song based on this (with cluster and all from today).
BUT how do I know the audio feature of the input song, if it e.g. not in my df with all the audio features?

hope this makes sense, maybe we can discuss in class after lunch..."
"i guess by function that gets the audio_features for that input track. but question is how to get track_id from track name because i couldnt find anything like that"
"we can use Alex’s giant database lol"
"Perhaps it would be more interesting if the initial input consisted of characteristics of the song, like a degree of danceability of funkiness."
"<@U01SJKB2MG8>, could we do that?"
"you would have to call the spotify api, but as I pointed out in the morning, the algorithm makes it hard to make sure you got the song the user wanted to have"
"<!channel>,
maybe a more clearer description about what the next step is for today. Start at *2.* Point *1.* is just to establish the link to the previous project steps.
1. Determine the audio features of the input song by querying the Spotify API with it. Store that result in a dataframe or numpy array (if the latter, keep track of which element in the array corresponds to which feature). Don't spend too much time on implementing any guessing that should be done by your program (whether user inputs the correct song). To get a working recommender ready, first assume that the user puts in a track name and/or an artist that *exactly matches* how they are stored in the spotify database.
2. take the vastness of songs you have collected together with their audio features and train a k-means model with them - similar how we did in lecture (scaling is important!). Keep in mind, that it doesn't make sense to train a model, when you have *artist* or *title* *name* or *track id* in the data. You need to however have the possibility to later (after your model has determined the cluster ids) reassign the correct *track ids* to the *rows. Y*ou can do this by just adding back the track id to the dataframe that contains the determined *cluster id's,* but of course only if you haven't shuffled your data rowwise. You can optimize a bit the parameters, but for a first iteration of your model, just go with the default values of KMeans and stick with it. Only improve later by tuning the parameters.
3. ""Predicting"" which *cluster id* a song belongs to, would work like this: take the audio-features of the song and put it into a numpy array, let's say `song_array`. The audio feature order must exactly match the order that the model has learned. Call the model with `KMeans.predict(song_array)` to make the prediction. The outcome is only one cluster
4. The recommendation would then work like this: Take the determined cluster id from *2.* and subset your spotipy dataframe to filter for this cluster with e.g. `df[df[""cluster_id'']==2]` and get a random song back from that subset. You can take a look at <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sample.html|pandas.DataFrame.sample>"
"Hm yeah makes sense to use function to get track id from track name. Guess I have to search for that then as well.

And yes, we could also ask the user input a feature rather then a song ... 

Hm hm hm lots to do here"
"<@U01RRV4JX6Z> woulnt it then just be a lookup? theres no prediction really"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7> the database is still processing"
"i guess your program should call the spotify api  like thamo said and print back all the top suggestions and make the user choose somehow"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7> 11h28min in , 14 more expected"
"hope they dont block your ip haha"
"well i just assumed that they get more calls more often by other apps accessing their API.. hade some timeout errors yesterday but since then its just running!"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7>, the idea would be for the user to deliver some characteristics and the computer to randomly assign the user a song with these characteristics..."
"Predicting a song the user might light according to certain parameters"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> since I ran the data through the standardscaler, can I assume that if i get the data back from spotify i will directly get the right cluster or do I need to scale that data as well?"
"scale it please with the same trained scaler that you used for your training data.
And then its a good idea to take `.fit_transform(X)` apart and do fitting and transforming seperately. So you would do:
```scaler = Standardscaler().fit(X)

X_prep = scaler.transform(X)```
and then later:
```X_song_prep = scaler.transform(X_song)```
"
"why is that? :exploding_head:"
"the splitting part I mean"
"because you want to ""pipe out"" the trained scaler after you fit it and save it. If you do just

`X_prep  = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)`
you don't save it in a variable to be used later"
"that little `scaler` variable contains all the means and standard deviations for all your features and knows how to shift your features"
"The dumb thing is that the spotify df does not have song and artist name. Did i do something wrong?"
"if you only took the IDs, it doesnt have song and artist, i catched it in the step of pulling the song ID"
"the feature extractor does not have song and artist names"
"Via the procedure from monday?"
"in whatever is the step that gives you the song ids, before getting the features"
"but i think that for what we are trying to do, you might not need it?"
"Yeah, that's true, but it seems stupid, though"
"yeah, i guess it's just how they have their internal database set up"
"random question: is there a way to ""save"" a fitted model and import it straight away instead of having to make it learn again in further iterations?"
"yes. pickle it into a pickle <https://machinelearningmastery.com/save-load-machine-learning-models-python-scikit-learn/>"
thanks!

"i dont know why, but try to change that k,2 to k,30"
"it mitght run but might not be a good result, im still understanding this"
"that doesnt work, dont listen to me! haha"
"maybe <@U01SJKB2MG8> can shine some light on what is being done there more specifically?"
"has anyone managed to get the audio features from a search?"
"you should be able to retrieve the ID of the song you searched, and then use the function to get the features"
"I can’t retrieve the ID"
"what does the search return?"
"a dictionary.
Then I access that dictionary;"
a[‘tracks’][‘items’]
"and that is a list, making it hard to navigate"
"go [0] and see where the id is"
"after tracks and items"
"id might be right there"
"You are an absolute hero, thank you!"
"no worries!"
"i just keep getting higher  silhouette score, the more clusters i add... i mean it doesn’t make sense to have that many clusters, does it?"
"it could! i think it is not very realistic to classify a lot of music tracks in 5 categories! I'm also wondering this so im runnning from 10 to 100 clusters"
"and see if there is a sweet spot in between"
"how many tracks are you working with?"
"Guys, did anybody got the same error while using 'KMeans.predict(song_array)'?"
"my 50k tracks are making me go sloooow"
"my laptop would die haha let me know which amout looks good for u. ill test it too"
"i have 35k"
"Alex, one more question, how did you unpack the features afterwards?"
"```

"got it, nevermind"
"looks like you didnt train the model, but not sure"
"if i have 51 clusters it splits all my songs in exacrly 699 songs per cluster :smile:"
"tested it and it seems, that piece of code there can't plot `k&gt;5` it seems. still figuring out why"
"ah... I see. It's because the figure is generated as 2 by 2 subplots and the way the plots for the clusters are assigned to the plot areas is determined by this `q, mod = divmod(k, 2)` and `ax=ax[q-1][mod]` expression.
Not really elegant because it only works for 2,3,4,5"
"Sorry to go back to an earlier issue, but: anybody work out how to get the song names ?"
"where are you stuck?"
"Playlist only has IDs - need the song name in our df as well"
"good point!"
"I managed to generate a working code in which, based on a first random recomendation, the computer selects  some more others that a similar to the randomly selected (building on the predictions made). When i replace ""random_song"" with ""filter_song"" in ""getCond = top_100[""cluster""][random_song]"", i get this error.:
```TypeError: Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column```
 Any ideas?"
"i dont get this. i need to add this one song to my whole song dataset and then scale it together? and then take it off again?"
"yeah i took that line off and plotted only the number of clusters i wanted to go for.. no good for comparative analysis but well"
"there is definitely something fishy there"
"yea i think i have some mistake somewhere because all of these 35k songs then correlate on 51 points"
"Once you scaled the data once, you want to save that scaling algo in a variable, so that the exact same scaling happens to new data.

Once you call the spotify api and get the features back, you want to run them through the saved scaler, not the original standardscaler, since using the original one would’nt return a result that is uniform with the scaled dataframe"
"this is because standardscaler takes mean and std and calculates the scaling from there, and that would look a lot different with only one datapoint compared to the whole dataframe"
"`scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)`"
"and next time you have to scale data you just call `scaler`"
"hope that made sense"

80 - ranked position 1 compared to itself

What does the question ""Understand the meaning of all columns"" mean?"

 I think with some columns we can determine certainly whether it is categorical or numerical.

But some have missing values, or are object, which the way I understand it, means that it is of mixed data types.

How would you determine whether the columns are numerical or categorical in that case?

Should we drop the missing values first and then convert the entries in the object columns into it's correct values?"

"good points! these are exactly the challenges to come across with real world data :slightly_smiling_face:
`customer lifetime value` for example is recognized as categorical - actually I would clean it first, cast it as float and add it to the numericals.

so answer: Double check what your first selection of numericals and categoricals is if you use for example `df.select_dtypes(np.number)`

Regarding dropping: Be careful if you drop rows in the categoricals or numericals dataframe only. Because if you later stitch them together, you end up with dataframes differing in length. What I would do here: Not drop any rows in the splitted numericals and categoricals. But before, immediately after concatenating the three dataframes (let's say your dataframe is then `df_all`) , at least drop the rows that have `NaN` values *only*
You can find those out for example with

"what is the field you are trying to pass to the url ?"
"i cant think of the business case you have - the blog article isnt a search, so im not sure how it would work … if you are passing the day of the week, for example, it would look like
<https://www.metroshoes.net/blog/?s=>&lt;weekday&gt;
if you are passing a product name eg shoes :
<https://www.metroshoes.net/blog/?s=shoes>
so im guessing the reason youre getting a 403 error is you do not have a valid field to pass to the url"
"cool website though - maybe you have a shoe data set ?"
"no, its is just a theory (joke). Since wednesday is the happiest day, maybe this could be the reason why the sales (quantity) are really bad."

"decentralized (which is the original spirit of cryptocurrency) and gouvernment issued are so far away from another, I doubt they’ll succeed…"
"leute we’re missing the bigger picture….Gold, Silver, Crypto….all so passé

the future is MANGOS (at least according to the ads that target me on facebook)"
"Oooof how could I miss this?"
"I think it very much depends on the issuing country. While China has the power to make it work, Venezuela clearly doesn't"
"China issued a cryptocurrency (multiple ones, to be fair). The last one has a build in “devalue” function, where the money is worthless if you don’t spend it in x amount of time.
Gouvernments controlling our currency is the reason for so many economic problems, I honestly hope that the new version of money we are going to use get’s rid of these flaws.
Build in inflation mechnanisms and incentives to spend the money quickly and not save it, is definetly not what society needs"
"And also definetly true what you say, but I wouldnt call it cryptourrency anymore, but electronic money.
And we definetly need layer 2 money applications that scale quicker than bitcoin.
I just hope we will get rid of one currency per country/area but adopt one global solution"
"I agree with you that this mechanism may be problematic. But it has been disproven that there is a sound correlation between government printing money and inflation."
"This is why economic orthodoxy moved from  Friedman to the new consensus macroeconomics/DSGE models"
"Reflecting more about it, there is a reason why the Chinese force people to use it in a certain period of time. To be money, a given unit of account like salt, metal or whatever you want must satisfy several requirements. One of this is to be an effetive unit of account, in that its value does not oscillate wildly with time, like in a scenario of hyperinflation. In short, it must effectively guide expectations for the wide public. If the chinese criptocurrency works exactly like bitcoin it wont have this property, at least not for everyone. I guess forcing people to use it before a certain deadline is a form of stabilizing its value. But I agree with you that this does not make sense if the other objective is to make it attractive for the regular investor and thus grant it with liquidity, which is another one of the desirable properties of money. I guess that not only the Chinese, but also the Americans and the Europeans, which probably will experiment with this policy solution, will have to find an adequate mix here.. Its all about policy experimentation. But I'm quiet confident that this government-generated cryptocurrency is the future, because the state is the lender of last resort and the entity ultimately responsible for stabilizing expectations and the business cycle..."

So just to finish what was said in the break out room.

Luke (Skywalker)  has the same name as the director of Star Wars, or is at least derived from it, hence George Lucas.

George Lucas channeled his hero journey into the movies :slightly_smiling_face:"
"burn the heretic"

ahahaha
"SW is overrrated!!!!!"
"just kidding, deep down if you look at the star wars series in analytical eyes its all about a family story, how the father was bad, and distant from the family but then the son came up as a good guy and convinced him to become good in the end"

"George Lucas was into Joseph Campbell and Jung I think.  So the way I see it is that each character is symbolic and represents parts of Lucas' psyche."
absolutely
blasphemy!!!!!!!
"but thats what people do in their movies, and why tarantino shows a lot of feet"
"well that escalated quickly"
"It's like Jung wrote the Red Book. Tolkien wrote LOTR."
"is this a good time to mention that though I have never seen star wars, i have been to the set at elstree studios where SW trilogy was filmed and ate in the canteen of the George Lucas Stage next to the big gold robot thing… not sure whats thats called"

"<@U01SJKB2MG8>, i was checking the German constitution and it does not say that decent and affordable housing is a basic right, like it is in Brazil. I guess that this reflects the better material conditions of Germany when its constitution was proclaimed. Perhaps by now this should change. What i wanted to say before was that lawmaking is not an exact science, as it is very much subject to interpretation. If one lobbyst says ""this is inconstutional"" and goes to court another one might say ""yeah, but here it says it is not"". Unfortunately peoples' basic rights tend not to be much considered these days"
"_Das Land habe seine Kompetenzen überschritten,_ says exactly what I said:slightly_smiling_face:, the state of Berlin overstepped its jurisdiction. The court did not rule that the matter of the law itself violates any article of the German basic law, the Grundgesetz - which initself is imho relieving :clap: and gratifying for both our sentiment, that there should be a basic right for housing one day in Germany. Because now there's still legal room for it to make such a law on federal level - which won't happen though if CDU/CSU should also win the next election :face_with_rolling_eyes:"

"My whole trading hypthesis is, that markets are constantly manipulated by the large key investors. You can see their traces in price and volume movements, its quite hard to hide billions of dollars in the chart.
And if you think about it, these players need to engineer the liquidity for their positions.
They often do this by ‘generating’ news that drives price into retail stops or force margin calls with large swings of price.
In unrgegulated markets, this is even worse, and thats why people are under the impression it is dangerous to trade, when in reality you just have to wait for the wave and ride it"

```map() is the first, and slightly simpler one. For example, suppose that we wanted to remean the scores the wines received to 0. We can do this as follows:```

Two thoughts following this:
1- I think I will treat Pandas as a separate language to learn. It seems like all the functions and use of brackets are distinct from the Python rules. - and maybe on its own it is not so complex to learn (+ I guess one of the most useful for everyday stuff)
2- Within Python, I find List Comprehension (where we put loops in one line)  really tough to get my head around."

The mentors will contact you / invite you to dedicated channels to coordinate the further meetings. Keep in mind, these are just groups for the stand up and it doesn't mean you just have to direct your questions to your ""mentor"". Of course you can still make use of the expertise of the whole teaching team and as we mentioned after the previous projects, place your questions first in the <#C0215VDBWPQ|final-project> channel, which ensures that you get help as fast as possible and by the LT/TA who is most knowledgeable (we all have our special fields of interest you might know by now :slightly_smiling_face:)"

Just had a look at it yesterday and this seems quite a lot :scream::sob:"
"Hi <@U01RN7BVD1C>, yeah i think that's right. Hang sent an email the other day reminding us of the deadline."
"I’m not that sure actually.. This is what’s in the deadline email for 11th April:
 “I suggest the below PROCESS for the CV in the following order:
Follow all suggested steps on your module Careerhack stage 1 to implement best practices for your CV structure draft &amp; LinkedIn profile - pay attention to keywords, metrics, language, etc.
Attend the CV &amp; LinkedIn workshop on Wednesday, 14th April at 6pm to get an idea of what recruiters look at &amp; how
After the workshop in week 4, activate resumeworded* premium and use their BASIC word template to optimise the content based on the tool’s feedback by using the function “Resume Targeting” which requires you to upload a job ad of your choice to get an effective scoring
Reach a score of 70 minimum and copy &amp; paste the optimised content from the resumeworded template to your final CV design
Upload the final CV design and LinkedIn URL to Careerhack on your student portal, so I can approve them via the system
(make sure the sharing option of the CV file is accessible)
Final deadline for stage 1: before the end of week 7 to give me enough time to go through your CVs. If there is anyone who wants to discuss regarding this stage, please make sure to have followed the above steps first and then book the 1:1.”"
"""Hey Francisco,

I hope you are doing well in your 2nd week :)

It is important to keep up with CareerHack, thus I want to remind you to *finish* *Stage 1* *by* the end of next week (*Sunday, 11th April*), if you are aiming to find a job after the bootcamp. 

We are going to have CV and Linkedin workshops in weeks 4 and 7 that are going to *build on top of your work!* 

Btw, I still need 2 volunteers from the Data group for 1 CV and 1 LinkedIn each, so I can review them as case studies during the workshop from a Tech Recruiting point of view."""

• 2:30 meet me back in the main zoom classroom, we will talk about how to evaluate logistic regression models, overfit and class imbalance. 
• 4pm robert will join us 
• the remainder of the day, there are a few optional labs in the Notion to keep you entertained, or you can work on tidying up your regression model to submit it on your student portal. PLEASE everyone submit a logistic regression notebook as your lab (in whatever state) today- either the iris data set or the bank A/B prediction- not just a copy of my or Flo’s notebook though, create your own version with a nice structure (we can tell if you copy+paste !)

Two things need to be done by you before or during (depeding on how quick you are with those things) Wednesday's lecture:

1. *Setup a* :spotify: *App and get the credentials*
head to <https://developer.spotify.com/> and setup an app:
1. click on DASHBOARD on the above panel
2. login in with your credentials
3. click ""create an app"", give it a name and if you want a description, tick the :tick_checkmark:, click ""create""
4. click the huge green box (left picture) for your app that was created. You should see your *Client ID* and if you click SHOW CLIENT SECRET, there's your *client secret* (right picture)*.* Especially don't share the latter with anyone / push it to github. You can revoke it though, if you accidentally did.

We need both the client id and the client secret to connect to the Spotify API and use the Spotipy wrapper.


*2.* :python:  *Install SpotiPy into your anaconda environment:*
`conda install -c conda-forge spotipy`"

This means we have just one other short lecture session tomorrow, between the morning class retro and lunch, but I will ask the TAs nicely if one of them will take you through some SQL or Python katas for some collaborative revision in the afternoon, to make up for it."

"UPDATE: (managed to improve my score with a little trick, which was including Ironhack as a work experience). I have a problem with Resumeworded. When i download my CV, it does so in Portuguese, and therefore my score in Resumeworded is lower than it should be because the algorithm doesn't recognize certain categories, such as skills. In my settings the language is english, but this happens regardless.. Did someone have the same issue?"

if not - *dont worry we arent saying to pay for a premium account*, just the freebie version - sign up here:  <https://www.spotify.com/uk/signup/>

you might have guessed already but later this week we will be using a webwrapper API - in this case spotiPy- to get hold of a playlist of songs; for that reason you will need to have a spotify account - you can of course delete your free account after the week is over!

"Hey <@U01S7BM4N81>, you said you wanted to check out econometrics. I recommend you to download Gretl and play around with the .csv files we have."
"Good criteria to check out the robustness of the models is to look at the asteriks of each variable. The more asterisks, the lower the p-value and the larger the probability that that independent varible explains the dependent one."
"Also take a look at the f statistic. The higher the better. It tells you if all the variables, as a group, fit well together to explain the dependent variable."
"Amazing, thanks! I'll check it out this weekend"
"Hey <@U01S65G72SY> do you know where in general the recordings are? :see_no_evil:

I hope you're having a relaxed May Day weekend! :hibiscus::bicyclist::fist:

Keep in mind that the week starts at *9 am* with a
*Careerhack Q &amp; A* with Hang (check our Notion calendar). It will happen here <https://ironhack.zoom.us/j/98542857475>
and will last until *10 am* (you also should have received an Email)

Those who have completed stage 1 of careerhack or are not looking for jobs have free time from 9 am to 10 am.

"Some preparations (can be done before lecture, but shouldn't take long):

• Make sure you can access the *Inspect Element* feature in your webbrowser (every browser nowadays should have this feature, with which you can inspect the html code):
    ◦ :apple_logo: MAC-OS users: It can be, that the feature has to be enabled first in Safari. <https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/139767/inspect-element-in-safari|How-To here>. Then you simply press `Command` + `Option` + `I` or do a rightclick on the element of interest and select `Inspect Element`
    ◦ :firefox: Firefox: Rightclick on the element of interest -&gt; ""Inspect"", or rightclick + `Q`
    ◦ :chrome: Chrome: Also, rightclick + ""Inspect"". More info on the inspector <https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/website/how-to-inspect-and-change-style-using-google-chrome|here>

"aww you guys! i think what robert would really love is anything you feel like you want to send him. he loves getting emails but also hand written letters /cards  (i can give you their address in chilliwack, canada) . He does not cook, im afraid, Isabel… but he will prompt my aunt Leri to cook for him now he is vegan…
he loves all and any books, he will treasure whatever you come up with but one suggestion from me would be - take a photo of the whole class doing bear hugs and send it to him with an email and comments from some of you. it wont cost a thing, and he isnt really into packaging and plastic waste as you can imagine"

"in the solutions section, what is the <https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-customer-analysis-round-1/blob/master/.github/stale.yml|stale.yml> file for /how is it opened/launched :face_with_rolling_eyes:"
"I did not find it. But yml is an extension for the python environment. It shows the requeriment (libraries and their versions) we need to run the project."
"not relevant  for students. Only for the Ironhack education team internally."
"I found it now. Don’t worry about it and other files inside .github . They are usually hidden (with dot in the beginning of the name),  they are important only to the autor of the repository."
"btw... that's also not the solutions section:slightly_smiling_face:"
"yes you are in the actual lab section Neil! if you remember, we share the solutions with you via Notion - if the solutions were stored right next to the lab that would be quite boring for us all!"
"Software and Hardware setup requirements for this week (unit2):
• Monday - no additional setup needed, you will be primarily working on your project - in python/ pandas/numpy. Ensure you can actively participate in your group by testing your audio/ video on zoom. If this is not possible on your laptop, try the zoom app on your phone or tablet
• Tuesday - zoom - as we have class presentations in the morning, any and all of you should be able to share your screen. Please enable/ test this, plus testing audio functionality / internet speed tests as appropriate eg <https://zoom.us/test|test zoom>, <https://www.speedtest.net/|test speed> 
• Tuesday lecture and labs - we will be using jupyter notebook with numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries. Nothing new to install but check that your chosen conda environment (if you are using conda) works with matplotlib and seaborn or use your base jupyter environment. 
• Wednesday + Thursday we all will need tableau public (minimum) or tableau desktop (optional) 2021 version. I have given you a lab for tuesday afternoon to complete this setup. I would recommending using the quickstart (same lab) to ensure your laptops can cope with tableau and zoom. Unfortunately tableau is memory hungry and there are minimum tech specs listed <https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/products/techspecs|here> - the alternative on the day will be to work on a browser version, so do let us know if you are struggling with your hardware/RAM so we can prepare for this. 
• Friday- we will return to Python and will be using numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn + <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html|sci-kit_learn> which will require an install on your chosen python env"

if you finish the `Lab | Customer Analysis Round 2` you will realize that the date column contains only entries for January and February. So obviously the exercise to filter for Jan/Feb/Mar is a bit dull.

So I overwrote the month number in the csv with random integers. You can give that csv a try, if you want to have it a bit more spiced up :grin:"
"Should we then make a copy of our Jupyter Notebook with Customer Analysis Round 2 and then read marketing_customer_anlysis_x.csv there? :slightly_smiling_face:"
"no, not necessary :grin:
just if you want to play around with another dataset that is a bit more exciting with respect to the tasks.
and don't use my data for the coming Labs please, for consistency"
Oki!
thanks!
"Ok, the dataset will give you an error if you solved the lab properly. Here's why: I subsituted the month part of the values in that `effective_to_date` column randomly with values between 1 and 12. So far so logical. But then also date values with for example ""7/31/11"" got the 7 subsituted for a 2, which would make it February the 31st, which doesn't exist and since pandas datetime is smart, it will throw you an error like this (screenshot).

Regarding the upcoming Lab `Customer Analysis Round 3` : I inspected it and reworked the instructions. Please take the same data, but take these instructions:

&gt; For this lab, we still keep using the `marketing_customer_analysis.csv` file. You can find the file in the `files_for_lab` folder.
&gt; 
&gt; *Get the data*
&gt; Use the same jupyter file from the last lab, `Customer Analysis Round 3`
&gt; 
&gt; *EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) - Complete the following tasks to explore the data:*
&gt; * Show DataFrame info.
&gt; * Describe DataFrame.
&gt; * Show a plot of the total number of `response`s broken down by response kind.
&gt; * Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by the total claim amount.~ Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind. Try a boxplot and distribution plot, for each `response` kind. For the distribution plot, try to plot both kinds of responses in one chart (you can try with seaborn's histplot, using the `hue` parameter).
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by income.~ Create similar plots like in the task before, but for `Income`
&gt; * *NEW*: Create a scatterplot between `total claim amount` and `income`. Play around with the parameters of the scatterplot (markersize? alpha?) and try to identify more features within the data just visually. You can also try different seaborn plots. Check to find suitable ones: <https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/134-how-to-avoid-overplotting-with-python>"
"Hey, so Im still not getting how to get my data from Git hub into Jupyter, clone then pull..anybody else still having problems with this? maybe a TA could walk me through it"
"I am on it"
"let me know if someone else needs help"
"* Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.

is only the response=""yes"" that count as response? or is either response=yes, no a response?"
"It actually means 'number of responses broken down 1st by response kind, 2nd by response channel'"
"So, number of responses on the y axis, response kind on the x-axis, and then the bars for the both responses again split by the sales channel"
understood!

"The Video from <@U01RXCQHMHT> was very helpful :clap:"
"for this:

&gt; Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind.
trying to use
`sns.boxplot(x = 'Response',y = 'total_claim_amount', file1=file1)`
`plt.show()`

but I always get errors for the column names:

""Could not interpret input 'Response'"" :thinking_face:  ... did I not install Seaborn properly?"
"the `.boxplot()` doesn't have a parameter called `file1`. you must provide `data` instead, So...
```sns.boxplot(x = 'Response',y = 'total_claim_amount', data=your_dataframe)```"
"still the same when I add the name of my dataframe :confused:"
"sns.histplot(data=file, x=""Total Claim Amount"", hue=""Response"", multiple=""stack"")"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> hi Flo, this return AttributeError : module 'seaborn' has no attribute 'displot'"
""
"Do you have any idea why?"
"Yes, in the newest version of seaborn, they begin to ditch the `distplot` and start aggregating all the distribution plots under `displot()`  (missing the ""t""). `displot` is contained in seaborn version 0.11.1, so in case you get that error, you might want to open another git bash window, activate your current environment and do
```conda update seaborn```"

"its true, for interviews as data analyst or data scientist roles, you will very often be sent a test on your SQL and python skills which looks a lot like this. one of the best skills is figuring out how to work with this software!"

"So what's the point?"
"well i think you are slightly misunderstanding it… with pandas, for example, we might have a few different ways of solving a problem. but the kind of challenge on code wars is more absolute - for example todays challenge, write a function, that can handle the introduction of an integer and then provide a response if its odd or even - one of the tests will be did you write a function"
"and your solution is not a python function"
"but it also said write a script"
"define a function means getting something like :
def test_function(argument1) :
  # Do something with the code, and the argument.
  print(argument1)

# Calling the function."
"""Create a function (or write a script in Shell)"""
"oh i see where you got that from now! makes more sense …"
"I proceeded with the latter"
"if we've made multiple errors on the work do we still upload them? asking for a friend"
"ah got it… but it still isnt a shell function right?"
"Well, I'm new to this. Is what i wrote a script?"
"oh no its not - its a logical argument i believe.
maybe im misunderstanding, but i imagine if you had the full shell script it would have passed the tests.
But as flo said, you can also see what kind of tests are being pushed on your code… like are decimals being introduced, or 0s - whatever kind os stretch test to ensure the code is good."
"this is a bit of info about shell scripting <https://www.shellscript.sh/functions.html>"
"and this about building functions in python <https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp>"
"these might help! but also know we will do much more of this in class through the course"
"soon it will feel more familiar :slightly_smiling_face:"
"and there are still a few ways of doing the same thing - dont worry! if you look at the solutions on code wars you will see things like
```def even_or_odd(number):
    return 'Odd' if number % 2 else 'Even'```
and
```def even_or_odd(number):
  if number % 2 == 0:
    return ""Even""
  else:
    return ""Odd""```
which return the same output but are structured differently!
• one thing to remember is you wont see a lot of print() on code wars as successful solutions - a little tip :wink:"
"yes i think thats the best approach actually"
"you can always update the notebooks in github later, but for now, it means we can have a look at how youre getting on and where those errors are coming up"
"What is the purpose of functions in Data Analytics? To test models, for example?"
"A linear regression?"
"ooh good question…. functions are effectively used to do tasks either repeatedly or robustly (applying rules, arguments, transformations)… you may remember in class that we wrote a clean function to tidy up the gender column, but theres a tonne of ways we could use a function in a data analysis process, from cleaning, through EDA, to predictive modelling. heres a cool example of a function you can use right now
def histograms_numeric_columns(df, numerical_columns):
    ‘’'
    Takes df, numerical columns as list
    Returns a grid of histograms
    ‘’'
    f = pd.melt(df, value_vars=numerical_columns)
    g = sns.FacetGrid(f, col=‘variable’,  col_wrap=4, sharex=False, sharey=False)
    g = g.map(sns.distplot, ‘value’)
    return g
….this is a time saver function…. instead of making a bunch of separate histograms, return all your columns as a grid of histograms. we can look at this in the morning if you like ?"
"a linear regression is a model, rather than a function, and we will start using them next friday :slightly_smiling_face:"
"ok, Sian already answered while I was typing. :grin:

The function serves the purpose to be able to ""atomize"" tasks. (Not only) in data analytics, we're facing the problem to be just overwhelmed by the task in front of us. So the general approach is: break the task into smaller tasks, which then get broken down again into smaller tasks etc.... and for the lowest ones, you would write a function, solve that problem, and then go one level up, reusing that function and solve the problem on the next higher difficulty level (related to _First Principles thinking_ I guess).

In practical terms, when it comes to code, this has the advantange that your code is - as Sian said -
• *scalable* (you don't need to reinvent the wheel at higher levels),
• your code is *reusable* for yourself and others,
• your code is *outsourcable* when you put it in functions*,* out of a notebook for example, to keep your Notebook clear and reduced to only the things you want to show (most of the time, it's the results). You would then import it as we import e.g. pandas right now, `from my_module import my_function` (we can have a workshop on that)
•  it's *robust.* if one function fails to do the job, it may break, but the rest of the code may continue running. You can even implement Error handling in exactly that function to get information in case of an error, why it failed (comes later in the bootcamp, crucial for example in _Webscraping_)
• it's easier to maintain / repair / upgrade. Dependencies are much easier to handle etc.
• Personal feeling: It feels nicer in my head to solve a problem piece by piece
Of course, all of this is merely theoretical at this point but as tasks become more and more complex, you're starting to whish for functions :slightly_smiling_face:"

*mindframe
"For me the course until now has been a combination of completely easy stuff with other things that I still fail to grasp"
"well, I would say, functions in a programming world are conceptually not really different compared to your example.... in python it would maybe be something like this:
```def get_gdp(c, i, g, t, x, m):
  y = c + i + (g - t) - (x - m)
  return y```
they also just mimic the concept of functions in math as a relation between two sets (elements of set X are associated with exactly one element of set Y). With the difference in programming being that functions can perform so much more that just project from one set to another"

"thanks <@U01RSRE0N3D> for a fun icebreaker !"
"i'm new with Notion calendars :smile:

I see that a lot of modules (so we call them that?) dont have specific times attached... is that because the order can change throughout the day?

what's the prioritization? 1 is most important and 10 least important?"
"Yea, time changes all the time (if there are more questions) or as you said rearranging, thus we did not see the need to include them, however, we will always let you know if you need to be somewhere :))
(1 = crucial, 5+ = less important)"
"Regarding the maximum of three days absences rule, what happens if someone has Corona?"
"Make sure to let us know and we will figure something out!"
:thumbsup:
"absolutely! these are scary times, and we take the health of everyone very seriously. if it happens : of course let us know, but also we will find a way to manage it and the important thing is to stay home and rest :slightly_smiling_face:"
"also i use the prioritisation to manage the display of everything over a day so dont pay too much attention to a priority.
- You will get comfortable with Notion during the week, dont worry - the main thing is so you can see what each day contains and access the slides/ data/ labs /assignments and recordings in one place."

"i had some feedback from Hang on the stages of the career tasks and the deadlines :
*Hang*  [09:17]
Hey @sian d, thanks for raising it! I gave them 2 deadlines.

• Sunday, week 3 - Having applied all suggestions from Careerhack  stage 1 on their linkedin &amp; CV (without activating the optimisation tool, resumeworded)
• Sunday, week 7 - Having optimised their linkedin &amp; CV WITH resumeworded to a score of at least 70
[09:19] the reason why i split this is because they only have a 60 premium access to resumeworded, which I want them to activate in the 2nd half of their bootcamp.

So after the deadline week 3, I am doing a workshop in week 4 on wednesday evening to already give them an understanding what recruiters look out for. Weeks 4-7 are more for optimisation because that’s also when the bootcamp starts getting busier.
[09:21] let me know if this is clear, I do understand that this staged process can be a bit confusing - will make it clearer for the next bootcamp."
"thank you for sharing :slightly_smiling_face:"
"Thanks! That’s very helpful!"

"<!channel>,
 :microscope: *regarding the today's labs (after lecture/lunch)*
please stick to these ""improved"" instructions (and not the ones you find under the github link):

• *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.5*
1. Select all the actors with the first name ‘Scarlett’.
2. How many films (movies) are available for rent and how many films have been rented?
3. What are the shortest and longest movie duration? Return the results as columns with the names  `max_duration` and `min_duration`.
4. What's the average movie duration expressed in format (hours, minutes) Return the result as columns with the names `hours` and `minutes`?
5. How many distinct (different) actors' last names are there?
6. Since how many days has the company been operating (check the `DATEDIFF()` function)? Hint: rental table
7. Show all rental information with additional columns `month` and `weekday`. (hint: `DATE_FORMAT()` ). Get 20 results.
8. Add an additional column `day_type` with values _'weekend'_ and _'workday'_ depending on the rental day of the week.
9. How many rentals were made in the last month of renting activity?
.... stay tuned, improved instructions for the other labs will maybe follow"
"<!channel>,
:microscope: for *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.6*
please use these instructions

1. Get the unique release years.
2. Get all films with _ARMAGEDDON_ in the title.
3. Get all films which title ends with _APOLLO_.
4. Get 10 the longest films.
5. How many films include *Behind the Scenes* content?
6. Drop column `picture` from `staff`.
7. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.
8. Add a rental for movie ""Academy Dinosaur"" by the customer ""Charlotte Hunter"" from employee Mike Hillyer at Store 1. You can use current date for the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table. *Hint*: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there. You can query those pieces of information in other tables. For eg., you would notice that you need `customer_id` information as well. To get that you can use the following query: 
```select customer_id from sakila.customer
where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER';```
Use similar method to get `inventory_id`, `film_id`, and `staff_id`.

9. *(Optional, you can skip this)* Delete non-active users, but first, create a _backup table_ `deleted_users` to store `customer_id`, `email`, and the `date` (use `CURDATE()` , <https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_curdate.asp|link>) for the users that would be deleted. Follow these steps:
    ◦ Check if there are any non-active users
    ◦ Create a table _`backup table`_ as suggested
    ◦ Insert the non active users in the table _`backup table`_
    ◦ Delete the non active users from the table _`customer`_"

_Why would I need that?_

• if at all, used in the Data Science field
• to get a deeper understanding of how Python works (what's all the fuss about `class` es in Python?)

"As one of our follow up actions from yesterdays poll :

• for this weeks GNOD project - I have put a very simple minimum viable product together in jupyter notebook which takes a user input (song name) and compares it to the top 100 to provide a song recommendation. This is for the first product image (shown in the notebook) and can be adapted to the names / columns of your own top 100 variables.
• in addition, this could, of course, be extended for the second version of the product (the spotipy songs+ features, kaggle database, unsupervised clustering) , and can be added to by modularising the scraping code, recommender function, spotipy code etc 
i will be available in a breakout room later this afternoon for a q&amp;a on how to use this template."

In Python strings these have the effect of escape characters and you want to remove them / substitute them accordingly (with a whitespace for example). Read more here: <https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_escape_characters.asp>

you can test them out by printing some string that includes those characters"

<@U01SJKB2MG8> what are data structures then?"
"the takeaway is basically that e.g. a pandas dataframe is built out of
• a series datatype
    ◦ which in turn is built on numpy (arrays)
        ▪︎ which again makes use of python fundamental datatypes
• an index datatype
so you have datatyp ""encapsulation"""

"staphney is your middle name? so pretty!

I love the background colour and all the white space you’ve chosen to go for  - i think it makes it look nice and clean. Also you have gone for very minimal labels - its a style i haven’t seen before---im not 100% with you :slightly_smiling_face: , but i like the way you have executed that. Good choice of simple colour scheme, not overwhelming.
• it would be nice if the profit filter controlled the other charts too - so we saw the top customer list and category view change. 
• also it would be nice if the category filter controlled more than one chart
• the lollipop chart needs a little work - looks to me, when furniture is selected, as if the axes arent snyc’d anymore, as the circle  is somehow offset from the bar (not a problem on office supplies), but also the bars and circles could be adjusted to align better. Typically the top of the lollipop is bigger than the width of the bar.
• check your map- in line with my rule of users will do anything you dont want them to, i could zoom out on the map - I normally turn off that zoom or switch to pan mode when publishing a map
• i really like that the map filters the other charts - but you could edit those tooltips to make them look nicer / be more relevant "

"its a bit visually busy - one way you make it less so is working on removing and labels, particularly axis labels that are unnecessary to the story. sometimes you can get away with a good tooltip and remove the axis altogether.
Good job with the floating legends and filters though, plus i quite like the bottom left bar chart labels."
"i think it would be better if the charts were interactively linked, as at the moment they are just placed… something to work on for the future"
"and it is pretty. I like that you used floating legends and filters to make better use of the space, that you chose a title which is a ‘call to action’ - encouraging people to dive in and explore the data themselves.
I agree with the colours - be careful that people dont assume the same shade of purple means the same thing in two places but nice use of colour background and outlines - if im being fussy the boxes are not quite aligned here"
"but overall good job! this dashboard is not overwhelming :slightly_smiling_face:
Maybe something to work on is the interaction between the charts"
"I agree with Thamo, nice idea to show the lapsed customers in a staggered kind of bar chart :slightly_smiling_face: i would consider the placement of your two colour legends on the right… i feel like you dont need the legend for RFM rc tier as you have the headers in the chart itself. The other legend (the customer segments) you could show the names of the segments in the bar chart and lose that legend too, or float it, in the white space above the big yellow bar.
In general its a good idea to avoid axis which make us have to turn our heads sideways :owl:- theres one axis label doing that now, on your rfm rc tier bar chart.
nice job on the comments - try making that font bold and a bit bigger?
agree with Marian -  put white font on the grey header blocks- i would even add a matching grey outline to the charts to hold it all together
overall - great job!"
"really nice layout Olubunmi! i like the consistent use of colours bar chart to line chart - as a consequence i would avoid using blue again on the map, to save any visual confusion. good size font for the titles, its clear and easy to use.
consider changing the filters from multi select drop down to single button select - this avoids anyone unticking all options and ending up with nothing to look at! We can talk about different options for placing your filters… the truth is they can go anywhere!"
"stepping up with a movie version! nice one :slightly_smiling_face:
i like that youve used a srong, bold font for your titles and considered sizing for an intuitive layout. Its a nice layout too, very logical, and i like the colours.
you seem to have an issue in the filters top right - they are too squashed, so maybe go back and give it more space when you can"
"its great that your region filter affects everything, but the date filter only changes the map, which could be a bit confusing because thats not near the map, its at the top of the dashboard - i would expect it to filter everything.
nice use of a floating legend for the map. when publishing a map its a good idea to turn the zoom functionality off so your end users dont end up really zoomed out"
"not quite the dashboard lab we were working on but ok!
without legends on the scatter plots having the multiple trend lines are hard to interpret - can you think about adding legends , having just one trend line , and instead of lots of small coloured circles which clash with the trend line, you could potentially eliminate all the extra colours or have one grey trend line. Once a scatter plot gets visually busy its worth switching from shape to circles, which can be faded, and show the density better with an outline, so I would have  think about that.
nice use of the bold blue headings - watch out for the _condition of property_ axis, its quite squeezed and the label doesnt fully display on my laptop- in fact you can drop the axis labels i think as each scatter contains the same information on x and y"
"hi thanks for the feedback, I will review my dashboard, I used this data so Id complete my project file"
"yeah I agree with Neil you might want to turn the zoom control off :slightly_smiling_face: we are too used to google maps arent we :slightly_smiling_face:
i like the floating layout, making best use of your space. I would drop the grid lines from the bar charts to keep the whole look clean, or do the same as you did with the lollipop chart - looks like they are really faded out.
Did you consider creating a dashboard title ? it feels sort of lost without it.

the profit legend could go further up the map, nearer to the view title, the category legend is possible unnecessary - something to be careful of - that legend is placed next to california at the moment, which also is blue - suggesting california is furniture, so consider your colour choices.

with so much space going for the  map i think you need to have more information on your tooltip, maybe a viz in tooltip ? but certainly clean the tooltips up a bit!"
"nice, simple three part grid structure - i think it would look neater if you had turned off the grid lines, put a title on the dashboard to bring it all together. I would recommend you to revise and test your dashboard actions … i dont think this is what you wanted to happen"

<https://public.tableau.com/profile/sam.katterfield#!/vizhome/recyclingandbeer/RecyclingBeer>

I too was messing with that London recycling set… on the <https://data-ft-ber-03-2021.slack.com/archives/C01SAEL4UKF/p1619686877001500|thread above> there was talk of adding bars on each borough…but…. i cant figure it out. ‘Bars’ gives me HUGE bars on each borough (all the same height and just varying by width….not ideal)… Gantt chart gives me teeny tiny bars of the same(ish) size.

Which formatting option am I not seeing?"
"yes colour and layout are not ideal…started getting too creative with backgrounds…. and the beer prices were in pence, took me a while to get them into pounds with the right symbol :neutral_face:"
"uhhh i LOVE the bier icon!!!"
"but yes the bars look very funny that way, like a raining cloud. Would be interesting to know how to change that scale."
"<@U01RN7BVD1C> i’m having doubts over the data quality….cant remember a London beer ever being that cheap :thinking_face:

unless the figures are taken from a <https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0&amp;err=1&amp;mid=1m12qzR7wcMI9JC8PzL0PzxMBay0|Sam Smiths pub>"
"hahaha yeah thats quite cheap, nearly berlin euro prices hmm"
<@U01RW140HBP>
"wow ! quite the bar chart over map combo lol
so what I can see quickly is that although you have Year in your beer data, I cant see any evidence you have london borough, in your beer data - hence the price of beer would be the same for all parts of london - is that what you expected ?  price ranges from 2.26 in 2003/4 to 3.70 in 2019/20, which does feel cheap for london!

as to your visualisation, you are using the size of bars, over the top of the map - but this is duplicated encoding, because you have created a copy of latitude, then changed the display of latitude to bars, even though its just displaying the same information as on the original map.
what are you trying to show on the map ? because if i strip the bars away we just have a map and beer, then it makes sense"
""
"and well done for getting the beer icon in there and making the beer grow over time… i think if you could get an average price by borough (no idea where from) or a london beer price (i think this must be nationwide) then this would be great stuff!"
"oops…. yes… now I see the beer prices are from the ONS, so will be nationwide:

<https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/czms/mm23|https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/czms/mm23>

per borough would be fun, but a challenge :joy: …having it just for london was the plan

I'm just trying to show some bars on each borough…. shorter ones for lower numbers, taller ones for higher numbers…mainly for the lolz

using latitude twice came from here… but their bars on the US map example look sensible :thinking_face:

Interesting to see here:
• low prices come in all conditions and grades (referring to sub 200k)
• High prices usually have a condition of 3+ AND a grade of 4+
• There’s no high grade-low condition-cluster (I assumed this, and it is true)
• Very high condition and very high grade correlate to higher prices, but are likely not the cause of them"

only negatives i can see - i think theres a sizing problem - the dashboard is published quite long, not too wide, and in line with my rule about testing everything the users can do, at the moment i can zoom out of the map by mistake - i always turn that feature off :slightly_smiling_face: and change the map to pan, rather than zoom"

"fire! theres a fire! good work Francisco. this dashboard is really quite sophisticated in the insights and visually balanced - youve done a good chunk of statistical analysis here and dug into the why, of what makes westminster an outlier. I like the colour scheme (goes well with the fire theme) though i would think about a different colour for the scatter plot- maybe a brown, so it stands out but not too much. also a great use of a polynomial trend line! i hadnt spotted that :slightly_smiling_face:
some tips - i think you could get away without the label ‘borough name’ at least on one of the charts - because its quite intuitive. the chart on the bottom right - i feel like you need a better header that doesnt run out of space.  - maybe something short like ‘popln / borough’
everything else is tidy, but rather than being an interactive dashboard its more of a infographic, because youve answered the questions. It would have been nice to see some interactive pieces with an end user in mind"

"*Indexing question*
I want to iterate through a dictionary and retrieve values where they exist. But the key only appears in some of the items. So if I just include it in the for loop it breaks the code (looking for a key that does not exist).
I need smth that says:

if textlist[0]['reply_count'] is in the item then
    give me it
else:
    don't

*Any ideas?* "

"*what is an elevator pitch?*
Tomorrow we will ask you to deliver a succinct verbal proposal to us for your final project.
I am calling it an elevator pitch because we want you to be brief - stay within 1 minute …. we might ask you to expand on any of the following:
• whats the data question /hypothesis? 
• why have you chosen this topic?
• wheres your data coming from?
• are there any challenges you can foresee with the topic? "

"Thanks Kosta :slightly_smiling_face:"
"as a reminder, here is what you need to have prepared"
Welcome!
"i did say a 1 minute pitch, kosta"
"was gonna say….5 minutes is a big elevator :smile:

random looks very alphabetical haha"
"one of those skyscrapers in dubai ?"
"please stand by
<https://youtu.be/VBlFHuCzPgY>"
"for the first time ever i'm called top of a list that's arranged alphabetically, my surname starts with S :'("
"There is something I'm still struggling to understand with multiclass classification (or with classification problems in general). The output array, which is actually a quiet large one, is a list of likely predictions. It is used to construct the classification model's metrics. Correct? is there a hierarchy between those values? In the sense that the first value of the array is the more likely one?"
"I feel you Alex, I’m also usually the last :smile:"
"probably more a question for <#C01S58JN5FT|lab-help>. But anyway...
Yeah, mostly correct. Although there's no hierarchy.

The output (let it be `y_predict` ) is an array with values of the different ""classes"" (like the four flower species in the iris dataset). It is of equal length as the feature dataframe (let it be `X_test` ) which you put in the model to predict them. The metrics for classification (<https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-classification-evaluation-metrics-you-must-know-aa97784ff226|True negatives, True positives, False negatives, False positives, accuracy score, F1 error, F2 error, accuracy, precision, recall>, ... ) are then calculated (or directly observable in the confusion matrix) by comparing `y_predict` with `y_test` . The latter is the _Truth,_ the first is the _predicted._ One basically looks for every pair of `y_predic` and `y_test` , how many are there of each combination? And then the confusion matrix is nothing but a tally chart of those possible combinations of the two arrays and in a best case scenario you only have matching pairs, which results in the fact that TN's and TP's are maximized.

So, to answer your last question: No, the order of the predicted label array `y_predicted` doesn't contain any hierarchy. It's just what your model has predicted for every corresponding line of your input dataframe"
"Thanks! No, its not for the lab..."
"I'm trying to understand this for the final project"
"That explanation was on point... I needed to understand where the number of output points came from... Thanks again!"
"yey it worked! just takes ages to scrape all top100 songs for all weeks from 2000-2021 :girl-grin:"
"wooohoooo… which site?"
"the original one, alex tip and an idea from the repo you shared did the trick in the end"
"page 255 from 520 done ... after 1,5 hours"
"how to use different tables without to connect them. I want to show different insights in a Dashboard"
"you have to click on the database icon on top in middleish on your screen right next to “infrastructure_2019” and then add a second table"
"Google has some very great tutorials :slightly_smiling_face:"
"Thanks, Thamo"
"Hi guys, I am trying to iterate though dates without success. My goal is to send one request to this api to get data foe each day in a range of time but I am getting and error. Can you see what I am doing wrong? Thank you:slightly_smiling_face:"
"Hey guys, maybe someone is free now, so I’ll give it a try: I’m trying to concat df’s from which some doesn’t have the same amount of columns as the other one, but most of their columns will match (the values will be different, so I need them to be copied one below each other). I want to fill in the columns which some of them lack with NaN values in the result df. I tried every parameter, none of them returns what I need. :disappointed:
`result = pd.concat([channel_gen, channel_books,`
                    `channel_dmemes, channel_dresource,`

<https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html>
"check this in the documentation, it shows many many ways that you can combine dataframes"
"yeah.. I tried through almost all"
"did you try to ignore the index?"
""
"i think you are trying an outer join right?"
"if columns are not same in all tables"
"can I show you what I mean in a breakout room maybe? it’s a bit hard to explain in writing :stuck_out_tongue:"
"i think you need to union your dataframes rather than merge = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)
• do this after setting the column names consistently across the frames. 
• get it right for two data frames before trying multiple data frames in one go 
happy to join you if alex cant help, but im sure he can"
"Hey Lilla. Looks like you got a solution - this sounds like a similar issue that was doing my head in all weekend :see_no_evil:.
If you are struggling maybe consider joining the  JSON files first (then to DataFrame afterwards). This is how I did it - but it wasn't pretty"
"Thanks both! Solved it with Alex, it was an outer join with index set to False - what I did already but to test I was checking the .head instead of .shape. Maybe more coffee will do  :sweat_smile:"
"haha coffee and food needed then- well done Lilla and <@U01RW2X7S9Z>"
"Hi, I’m having this error when importing csv to mysql. How should I deal with NaN values?"
"have you tried configuring the columns to allow nulls ?"
"Hi! Why is this happening? I have a range."
"try without the range"
"gives the same error: ‘int’ object is not iterable"
"if you want to iterate over a dataframe i suggest using df.iterrows() instead"
"what do you want to get in the end?"
"for the length of df.fruits_veggies i want to get the results 1 or 2 or 3 saved in body_score"
"ah ok it is wrong…this is probably adding to body score all the time :see_no_evil: but i want  a list"
"```for index, row in df.iterrows():
    if row[index of your fruit_veggies column] &lt; 2:
         do this```"
"and you probably want to append to the list and not sum it up :slightly_smiling_face:"
"you can use directly the column going for fruit in df['fruits_veggies']:
if fruit &lt;2:
and so on"
"like you dont need to user range len df if you iterate directly on the column"
"lol i’ve been iterrowing this whole time, thanks alex!
His solution is most likely quicker"
"i guess iterrows is good and faster if you need to operate on several columns for each operation, i haven't used it yet"
"that works!! Thanks to both of you :pray::blossom:"

"it is the syntax in dbeaver, sakila is the database"
"at least in selects, it is needed to specify the database"
"<@U01RW140HBP> is there a way to use max as window function without partition? I was experimenting and trying to filter results where return_date is equal to max return_date. something like:
 select *,
from sakila.RENTAL;
where EXTRACT(MONTH FROM return_date) = max ( EXTRACT(MONTH FROM return_date))"
"i would do this with a self join… hold that thought"
"so the challenge you have here is you cant use the window function as part of the where clause due to the order of execution … they are created in the Select, so cant also be used in Select:
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
this gets you half of the way there… in real life I would normally run the query *select max(return_date) from rental* first, spot that the max month is 9 and then just hard code 9 into my code :
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) = 9* 
…. however to do it programmatically, rather than manually, involves either a subquery or a self join - subquery would be the better way to go.
*select * , month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) =* 
*( select month(max(return_date))  from rental)*
here the subquery is the same as i started with …

a self join method is actually too messy (i tried a few versions) !"
"try using use sakila ;
then your INSERT INTO statement. But i think you will find there are some constraints on the table which require inserting more information than you have here. if you check the create statement for this table you will see we cant have null entries for
*first name* 
*last name* 
*address id* 
*store id* 
*user name.*
what this means is you will get an error if you try to partially fill a record not completing all those cells.
to get all that information, because we know Tammy is already a customer, you can query her records
*SELECT * FROM sakila.customer*
*where first_name = ‘Tammy’*
then you can amend your insert into statement to include that info
*insert into sakila.staff(first_name, last_name,  address_id, store_id, username)*
*values(‘TAMMY’,‘SANDERS’, 79, 2, ‘tammy’)*
if this doesnt make sense lets jump in a breakout room and go through it later!
*actually the user name is made up…. ‘tammy’ which is not obvious* "
"where is often easier ! and you can combine where with a subquery (we will go through this in tomorrows lecture) so that is flexible. However i normally use joins where i want fields from more than one table."
"if your database is clean, all tables have good referential integrity (ie no missing actor_id), it doesnt matter … in general i suggest to start a join with the transactional table but we dont really have transactions in this join between actors and the bridge table, so it could be done either way."
"select count(distinct actor_id) from film_actor
and
select count(distinct actor_id) from actor

"so a granular histogram is just counting the unique values… you would only see a count of more than 1 (ie a bar above average length) where the same exact value was replicated across multiple cities. I wonder if thats likely in this data set ?
most of the time in the histograms created in python you are systematically ‘binning’ the data points, as in grouping up the values into buckets, so you should see a bar in your histogram which covers similar values, ie the first bar might account for  all the values between 50 and 58, and the next bar would be all values between 58 and 66 .. try experimenting with the bin size as this might help it make more visual sense to you

"haha oh no :disappointed: But ok, then I will leave this for now"
"the RMSE for the linear model I gave you if you made no changes to the notebook, is 2.1. I would expect to see a RF RMSE go lower than that.
• Lower is better for RMSE (best i have seen is 0.65) 
• if you improved the model in any way before running the linear regression you could get a better RMSE.
• im impressed you got 0.9! well done :slightly_smiling_face: "

"something i tried is by fitting the scaler and using it in the validation data, my mse goes down to 0.76 before we start using the random forest. Is this a valid approach?"
"as the training dataset where we use the scaler in the beginning has more data, scaling the validation set with that same scaler improves accuracy in predicting the quality of the validation set."
"my question actually is, is the validation dataset the one we compare to the test, and we use the rest of the data (train) ONLY to train the model?"
"<@U01RW140HBP> the only thing i changed is the removal of negative weights but i though this was what we were supposed to do. so i get rmse 0,90"

"sorry this is the right one, my variables are named differently"
"Looks good!"
"you could additionaly check the standard deviation of Y, and see if most values lie within there to confirm. But the way the visual looks it seems like you got a pretty good result there :slightly_smiling_face:"

• This general question might lead you to more specific questions:

    b. How strong is that relationship?
    c. Which ad types contribute to sales?
    d. What is the effect of each ad type of sales?

Can you post an example? :blush:"
"i understand the confusion !

if you want to hop on a breakout room and talk it through let me know.
One way to think about averages/counts:
if i do a *select count(column) from table* - i will get one value back - think of *select count(student_name) from bootcamp* - the answer is 23.
same rule applies with *select avg(age) from bootcamp* - the answer is probably around 26
if i want to see more than one row i need to do a group by on each column that isn’t the value aggregated
*- select count(student_name), gender from bootcamp* 
*group by gender* 
would return male : 15 , female:8

I always start with joining the tables i need, select all the fields i want to use across the tables, then think about doing the aggregation using count/avg + groupby

However for qu 6 you are right that we can use one table, transactionhistory, because it has transaction ids and the date-- the challenge here is to extract the month and year for our group by."

You have to either overwrite `file3` with the output of that or use the `inplace=True` switch. Otherwise your changes won't be permanent. You just get an output shown, but no changes are made on the dataframe itself. So do something like

```file3 = file3.rename(columns={ 'state':'ST'})```

"random state is the base for a randomly generated number, it is there to ensure consitency if I recall correctly.
regarding test_size, we went with 0.7 for testing and 0.3 for predicting, but our model isn’t the most precise"
"you recall correctly… so if you want to compare iterations <@U01RKN0EGDV> you should always use the same random_state (i generally use 40… theres no reason for it i just chose it early on, 100 is the one you often see)"
"the size of the train test split is kind of up to you. worth experimenting with a larger train set to see what impact it is… but to avoid overfitting to the train i normally choose a 60/40 or 70/30 split"
"so then we should have the same random_state in our iterations, but the test_size we can play with it, right?"
exactly!
"just to ensure the data is splitting randomly according to the same system, we keep the random state number the same, then the results are comparable. changing the split is independent of that, the results remain comparable"
"should there be a predict_size or is that calculated from what you put as test_size?"
"i think is calculated, 1- test_size, so just enter test_size"
"the predict size is related to the test size <@U01S7KCL3DF> --- if i have 1000 rows in my test data set (X_test) with n columns, then y_test will be also 1000 rows (one column) and the predictions will be 1000 rows long, one predicted value for each X_test row."
"if you mean train size, thats just whats left from 100%"

• The pdf is a presentation on the credit cards case study - this is from a group project and is very polished, an A* effort overall (the rest of his github is also excellent but i wont share that today)
• the other (mp4) is a solo project on the housing case study, and he’s recorded it, which is cool-  its not a very technical presentation but he is a great storyteller

"the problem will be the separators in the file. in this case not consistently a comma i guess. best thing to do - open the file with a generic text editor and see what the separator is - then embed that in the read_csv () eg read_csv(filename,sep=‘;’)
or you can try this
```data = pd.read_csv('file1.csv', error_bad_lines=False)```
it will skip any lines which dont match the expected pattern though, you might end up with zero data"

"it comes down to *vectorized* operations (numpy, which does operations always on every element of the array *at once*) vs. some non vectorized ones in pandas. Although pandas builds heavily on numpy, meaning it benefits from that, there are certain ways you can use their API in which you accidentally loose this speed advantage... maybe with that `apply()` you have found one"

BUT how do I know the audio feature of the input song, if it e.g. not in my df with all the audio features?

hope this makes sense, maybe we can discuss in class after lunch..."
"i guess by function that gets the audio_features for that input track. but question is how to get track_id from track name because i couldnt find anything like that"
"we can use Alex’s giant database lol"
"Perhaps it would be more interesting if the initial input consisted of characteristics of the song, like a degree of danceability of funkiness."
"<@U01SJKB2MG8>, could we do that?"
"you would have to call the spotify api, but as I pointed out in the morning, the algorithm makes it hard to make sure you got the song the user wanted to have"
"<!channel>,
maybe a more clearer description about what the next step is for today. Start at *2.* Point *1.* is just to establish the link to the previous project steps.
1. Determine the audio features of the input song by querying the Spotify API with it. Store that result in a dataframe or numpy array (if the latter, keep track of which element in the array corresponds to which feature). Don't spend too much time on implementing any guessing that should be done by your program (whether user inputs the correct song). To get a working recommender ready, first assume that the user puts in a track name and/or an artist that *exactly matches* how they are stored in the spotify database.
2. take the vastness of songs you have collected together with their audio features and train a k-means model with them - similar how we did in lecture (scaling is important!). Keep in mind, that it doesn't make sense to train a model, when you have *artist* or *title* *name* or *track id* in the data. You need to however have the possibility to later (after your model has determined the cluster ids) reassign the correct *track ids* to the *rows. Y*ou can do this by just adding back the track id to the dataframe that contains the determined *cluster id's,* but of course only if you haven't shuffled your data rowwise. You can optimize a bit the parameters, but for a first iteration of your model, just go with the default values of KMeans and stick with it. Only improve later by tuning the parameters.
3. ""Predicting"" which *cluster id* a song belongs to, would work like this: take the audio-features of the song and put it into a numpy array, let's say `song_array`. The audio feature order must exactly match the order that the model has learned. Call the model with `KMeans.predict(song_array)` to make the prediction. The outcome is only one cluster
4. The recommendation would then work like this: Take the determined cluster id from *2.* and subset your spotipy dataframe to filter for this cluster with e.g. `df[df[""cluster_id'']==2]` and get a random song back from that subset. You can take a look at <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sample.html|pandas.DataFrame.sample>"
"Hm yeah makes sense to use function to get track id from track name. Guess I have to search for that then as well.

And yes, we could also ask the user input a feature rather then a song ... 

Hm hm hm lots to do here"
"<@U01RRV4JX6Z> woulnt it then just be a lookup? theres no prediction really"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7> the database is still processing"
"i guess your program should call the spotify api  like thamo said and print back all the top suggestions and make the user choose somehow"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7> 11h28min in , 14 more expected"
"hope they dont block your ip haha"
"well i just assumed that they get more calls more often by other apps accessing their API.. hade some timeout errors yesterday but since then its just running!"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7>, the idea would be for the user to deliver some characteristics and the computer to randomly assign the user a song with these characteristics..."
"Predicting a song the user might light according to certain parameters"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> since I ran the data through the standardscaler, can I assume that if i get the data back from spotify i will directly get the right cluster or do I need to scale that data as well?"
"scale it please with the same trained scaler that you used for your training data.
And then its a good idea to take `.fit_transform(X)` apart and do fitting and transforming seperately. So you would do:
```scaler = Standardscaler().fit(X)

X_prep = scaler.transform(X)```
and then later:
```X_song_prep = scaler.transform(X_song)```
"
"why is that? :exploding_head:"
"the splitting part I mean"
"because you want to ""pipe out"" the trained scaler after you fit it and save it. If you do just

`X_prep  = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)`
you don't save it in a variable to be used later"
"that little `scaler` variable contains all the means and standard deviations for all your features and knows how to shift your features"
"The dumb thing is that the spotify df does not have song and artist name. Did i do something wrong?"
"if you only took the IDs, it doesnt have song and artist, i catched it in the step of pulling the song ID"
"the feature extractor does not have song and artist names"
"Via the procedure from monday?"
"in whatever is the step that gives you the song ids, before getting the features"

"if i have 51 clusters it splits all my songs in exacrly 699 songs per cluster :smile:"
"tested it and it seems, that piece of code there can't plot `k&gt;5` it seems. still figuring out why"
"ah... I see. It's because the figure is generated as 2 by 2 subplots and the way the plots for the clusters are assigned to the plot areas is determined by this `q, mod = divmod(k, 2)` and `ax=ax[q-1][mod]` expression.
Not really elegant because it only works for 2,3,4,5"
"Sorry to go back to an earlier issue, but: anybody work out how to get the song names ?"

"good point!"
"I managed to generate a working code in which, based on a first random recomendation, the computer selects  some more others that a similar to the randomly selected (building on the predictions made). When i replace ""random_song"" with ""filter_song"" in ""getCond = top_100[""cluster""][random_song]"", i get this error.:
```TypeError: Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column```
 Any ideas?"
"i dont get this. i need to add this one song to my whole song dataset and then scale it together? and then take it off again?"
"yeah i took that line off and plotted only the number of clusters i wanted to go for.. no good for comparative analysis but well"
"there is definitely something fishy there"
"yea i think i have some mistake somewhere because all of these 35k songs then correlate on 51 points"
"Once you scaled the data once, you want to save that scaling algo in a variable, so that the exact same scaling happens to new data.

Once you call the spotify api and get the features back, you want to run them through the saved scaler, not the original standardscaler, since using the original one would’nt return a result that is uniform with the scaled dataframe"
"this is because standardscaler takes mean and std and calculates the scaling from there, and that would look a lot different with only one datapoint compared to the whole dataframe"
"`scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)`"
"and next time you have to scale data you just call `scaler`"
"hope that made sense"

so we can 'SELECT' fields from 2 different tables? and we don't need to 'SELECT'  the category_ID as it'll be in the JOIN down below?

```SELECT c.name, count(fc.film_id) as amount_films
FROM sakila.category as c 
JOIN sakila.film_category as fc 
ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
GROUP BY c.name;```
"
"you could also select ID, but i wanted to see the name rather then just a number :slightly_smiling_face:"
"exactly you only need to refer to one FROM table, but adding JOIN effectively gives us access to two tables Sam, you can select fields from either and both tables"
"and yes once you joined the tables via the shared key, you can select any field"
"i thought i had to have the 'field in common'/join category or whatever in my SELECT :see_no_evil:"
"do we have a copy of the material where you wrote the difference between PK and FK? :innocent:"

SELECT f.title, f.length,

FROM sakila.film f
WHERE f.length &lt;&gt; ' ';"
"But in general it should be right as you did it."
"not quite but close… the partition by length in this case is too unique, so we are ranking each length against itself… if i have a film thats 67 minutes long, another thats 80 mins long, and i rank by the partition length…
67 - ranked position 1 compared to itself
80 - ranked position 1 compared to itself

i am guessing you dont actually need a partition in this case. you can rank the films by length using :
*select title, length, rank() over (order by length DESC) as ‘Rank’*
*from sakila.film f*
*where length &lt;&gt; ' ' or length is not null;*"
"so drop the partition"

I defined 'available' as the return date being later than the rental date (unless there's an _'available for rent TRUE or FALSE'_ field that I missed)

Because each VHS/DVD was rented multiple times, I end up with multiple rows per inventory_id. Is there a better way to approach it so each inventory_id shows up just once?

`select distinct(i.inventory_id), i.store_id, f.title, r.rental_date, r.return_date from film f`
`join inventory i on f.film_id = i.film_id`

What does the question ""Understand the meaning of all columns"" mean?"
"And with these questions:

• Which columns are numerical?
• Which columns are categorical?
 I think with some columns we can determine certainly whether it is categorical or numerical.

But some have missing values, or are object, which the way I understand it, means that it is of mixed data types.

How would you determine whether the columns are numerical or categorical in that case?

Should we drop the missing values first and then convert the entries in the object columns into it's correct values?"
thanks

"and then for the third you leave that because you’ll make the columns lowercase anyways"
"good points! these are exactly the challenges to come across with real world data :slightly_smiling_face:
`customer lifetime value` for example is recognized as categorical - actually I would clean it first, cast it as float and add it to the numericals.

so answer: Double check what your first selection of numericals and categoricals is if you use for example `df.select_dtypes(np.number)`

Regarding dropping: Be careful if you drop rows in the categoricals or numericals dataframe only. Because if you later stitch them together, you end up with dataframes differing in length. What I would do here: Not drop any rows in the splitted numericals and categoricals. But before, immediately after concatenating the three dataframes (let's say your dataframe is then `df_all`) , at least drop the rows that have `NaN` values *only*
You can find those out for example with
```df_all.isna().all(axis=1)```"

"leute we’re missing the bigger picture….Gold, Silver, Crypto….all so passé

the future is MANGOS (at least according to the ads that target me on facebook)"
"Oooof how could I miss this?"
"I think it very much depends on the issuing country. While China has the power to make it work, Venezuela clearly doesn't"
"China issued a cryptocurrency (multiple ones, to be fair). The last one has a build in “devalue” function, where the money is worthless if you don’t spend it in x amount of time.
Gouvernments controlling our currency is the reason for so many economic problems, I honestly hope that the new version of money we are going to use get’s rid of these flaws.
Build in inflation mechnanisms and incentives to spend the money quickly and not save it, is definetly not what society needs"
"And also definetly true what you say, but I wouldnt call it cryptourrency anymore, but electronic money.
And we definetly need layer 2 money applications that scale quicker than bitcoin.
I just hope we will get rid of one currency per country/area but adopt one global solution"
"I agree with you that this mechanism may be problematic. But it has been disproven that there is a sound correlation between government printing money and inflation."
"This is why economic orthodoxy moved from  Friedman to the new consensus macroeconomics/DSGE models"
"Reflecting more about it, there is a reason why the Chinese force people to use it in a certain period of time. To be money, a given unit of account like salt, metal or whatever you want must satisfy several requirements. One of this is to be an effetive unit of account, in that its value does not oscillate wildly with time, like in a scenario of hyperinflation. In short, it must effectively guide expectations for the wide public. If the chinese criptocurrency works exactly like bitcoin it wont have this property, at least not for everyone. I guess forcing people to use it before a certain deadline is a form of stabilizing its value. But I agree with you that this does not make sense if the other objective is to make it attractive for the regular investor and thus grant it with liquidity, which is another one of the desirable properties of money. I guess that not only the Chinese, but also the Americans and the Europeans, which probably will experiment with this policy solution, will have to find an adequate mix here.. Its all about policy experimentation. But I'm quiet confident that this government-generated cryptocurrency is the future, because the state is the lender of last resort and the entity ultimately responsible for stabilizing expectations and the business cycle..."

So just to finish what was said in the break out room.

Luke (Skywalker)  has the same name as the director of Star Wars, or is at least derived from it, hence George Lucas.

George Lucas channeled his hero journey into the movies :slightly_smiling_face:"
"burn the heretic"
:smile:
ahahaha
"SW is overrrated!!!!!"
"just kidding, deep down if you look at the star wars series in analytical eyes its all about a family story, how the father was bad, and distant from the family but then the son came up as a good guy and convinced him to become good in the end"
"George was also Darth Vader's middle name... Fun fact"
"We SW orthodoxs don't say his name (G****e) anymore, <@U01RXCQHMHT>"
"there are a lot of layers in star wars movies, depends how you look at it"
"Strar wars? Is that a sequel to Harry Potter or?"
"and there it goes the controversy"
"i have something else to say"
"THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS 10H OF PEOPLE WALKING"
"George Lucas was into Joseph Campbell and Jung I think.  So the way I see it is that each character is symbolic and represents parts of Lucas' psyche."
absolutely
blasphemy!!!!!!!
"but thats what people do in their movies, and why tarantino shows a lot of feet"
"well that escalated quickly"
"It's like Jung wrote the Red Book. Tolkien wrote LOTR."
"is this a good time to mention that though I have never seen star wars, i have been to the set at elstree studios where SW trilogy was filmed and ate in the canteen of the George Lucas Stage next to the big gold robot thing… not sure whats thats called"
"back when i worked as a show runner lol"
"I am more a fan of the Matrix Trilogy :smile:"
whoa
"thats maybe time to reveal myself as a Harry Potter Fanatic"

"Matrix? Was that like Terminator but with VR?"
yeeeeeeees
"feeling the same about it"
"hehe i was a bit confused by the fuss to be honest"
"heard of people being in the set in tunisia of luke´s house in the desert, but the CANTEEN??"
"you must know who shot first, han or greedo"
"yeah they added the canteen onto the side of that stage and made it star wars themed. now anyone filming at elstree gets to eat among the characters (or at least the lifesize models)"
"its kitsch but fun"

"<@U01SJKB2MG8>, i was checking the German constitution and it does not say that decent and affordable housing is a basic right, like it is in Brazil. I guess that this reflects the better material conditions of Germany when its constitution was proclaimed. Perhaps by now this should change. What i wanted to say before was that lawmaking is not an exact science, as it is very much subject to interpretation. If one lobbyst says ""this is inconstutional"" and goes to court another one might say ""yeah, but here it says it is not"". Unfortunately peoples' basic rights tend not to be much considered these days"
"_Das Land habe seine Kompetenzen überschritten,_ says exactly what I said:slightly_smiling_face:, the state of Berlin overstepped its jurisdiction. The court did not rule that the matter of the law itself violates any article of the German basic law, the Grundgesetz - which initself is imho relieving :clap: and gratifying for both our sentiment, that there should be a basic right for housing one day in Germany. Because now there's still legal room for it to make such a law on federal level - which won't happen though if CDU/CSU should also win the next election :face_with_rolling_eyes:"

And if you think about it, these players need to engineer the liquidity for their positions.
They often do this by ‘generating’ news that drives price into retail stops or force margin calls with large swings of price.

someone (doesn't look like Berlin official) built an aggregator website that gathers all free covid vaccination appointments for the big vaccination centers in berlin.

"I think there's no need in treating Pandas as a new language, since it is just a library living in the Python ecosystem. But I get your sentiment. It takes time to get used to the datatypes (dataframe, series, index, ....) and how to interact with them - address columns, subset a dataframe etc.

on <https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/summary-functions-and-maps|Summary Functions and Maps> there’s this part

```map() is the first, and slightly simpler one. For example, suppose that we wanted to remean the scores the wines received to 0. We can do this as follows:```

Two thoughts following this:
1- I think I will treat Pandas as a separate language to learn. It seems like all the functions and use of brackets are distinct from the Python rules. - and maybe on its own it is not so complex to learn (+ I guess one of the most useful for everyday stuff)
2- Within Python, I find List Comprehension (where we put loops in one line)  really tough to get my head around."

"<!channel>,
regarding your *final projects* next week: As we announced, we're going to have *morning stand up sessions* in the morning from Monday until Thursday. These will happen in groups and Kosta, Sian and me will each mentor one stand up group. We distributed you into these groups:
• Sian: <@U01S0MFJ3HR>, <@U01S081EULS>, <@U01S65G72SY>, <@U01S6LCPM0C>, <@U01RNEU3SNA>, <@U01S6L7HLUC>, <@U01RXCQHMHT>

The mentors will contact you / invite you to dedicated channels to coordinate the further meetings. Keep in mind, these are just groups for the stand up and it doesn't mean you just have to direct your questions to your ""mentor"". Of course you can still make use of the expertise of the whole teaching team and as we mentioned after the previous projects, place your questions first in the <#C0215VDBWPQ|final-project> channel, which ensures that you get help as fast as possible and by the LT/TA who is most knowledgeable (we all have our special fields of interest you might know by now :slightly_smiling_face:)"

 “I suggest the below PROCESS for the CV in the following order:
Follow all suggested steps on your module Careerhack stage 1 to implement best practices for your CV structure draft &amp; LinkedIn profile - pay attention to keywords, metrics, language, etc.
Attend the CV &amp; LinkedIn workshop on Wednesday, 14th April at 6pm to get an idea of what recruiters look at &amp; how
After the workshop in week 4, activate resumeworded* premium and use their BASIC word template to optimise the content based on the tool’s feedback by using the function “Resume Targeting” which requires you to upload a job ad of your choice to get an effective scoring
Reach a score of 70 minimum and copy &amp; paste the optimised content from the resumeworded template to your final CV design
Upload the final CV design and LinkedIn URL to Careerhack on your student portal, so I can approve them via the system
(make sure the sharing option of the CV file is accessible)
Final deadline for stage 1: before the end of week 7 to give me enough time to go through your CVs. If there is anyone who wants to discuss regarding this stage, please make sure to have followed the above steps first and then book the 1:1.”"

I hope you are doing well in your 2nd week :)

It is important to keep up with CareerHack, thus I want to remind you to *finish* *Stage 1* *by* the end of next week (*Sunday, 11th April*), if you are aiming to find a job after the bootcamp. 

We are going to have CV and Linkedin workshops in weeks 4 and 7 that are going to *build on top of your work!* 

Btw, I still need 2 volunteers from the Data group for 1 CV and 1 LinkedIn each, so I can review them as case studies during the workshop from a Tech Recruiting point of view."""

• the remainder of the day, there are a few optional labs in the Notion to keep you entertained, or you can work on tidying up your regression model to submit it on your student portal. PLEASE everyone submit a logistic regression notebook as your lab (in whatever state) today- either the iris data set or the bank A/B prediction- not just a copy of my or Flo’s notebook though, create your own version with a nice structure (we can tell if you copy+paste !)  "
"Update: turns out people prefer functions over strings, thus I am going to talk about that!"
"ahhh ok"
"Ok, students assume we continue now. Haven't told them explicitely we will continue at 2:10"
"and will flo later continue/finish the guided lab we were doing together?"

"I have created a new channel - following on from our hastily thrown together vanilla python sessions last week - if you want more practices, support on the basics of python and do not yet feel comfortable with the python katas we have done in class so far (thats fine by the way! this is a non judgemental space) or if you feel like you want to ask questions somewhere but they might be basic - join this channel and we will feed into it for you. the channel is called *vanilla_plus_more*
……… Self select - some of you are flying through katas, don’t need this channel and should really not join………."

don't forget to get a :spotify:  spotify account for tomorrow :slightly_smiling_face:
< "
"<!channel>,
Two things need to be done by you before or during (depeding on how quick you are with those things) Wednesday's lecture:

1. *Setup a* :spotify: *App and get the credentials*
head to <  and setup an app:
1. click on DASHBOARD on the above panel
2. login in with your credentials
3. click ""create an app"", give it a name and if you want a description, tick the :tick_checkmark:, click ""create""
4. click the huge green box (left picture) for your app that was created. You should see your *Client ID* and if you click SHOW CLIENT SECRET, there's your *client secret* (right picture)*.* Especially don't share the latter with anyone / push it to github. You can revoke it though, if you accidentally did.

We need both the client id and the client secret to connect to the Spotify API and use the Spotipy wrapper.


*2.* :python:  *Install SpotiPy into your anaconda environment:*
`conda install -c conda-forge spotipy`"

We did get shown how to turn null values into mean value - but this is still not ideal in this case. Would be better to just discount the null values from the income column - (by calling them NaN ?)"
"Tried to find a way yesterday, but didnt get there"

"Every group except two :wink: - only Lilla and Neil have sent a song so far"
":cactus:ouch! pretty poor show!

ok @everyone lets get those :notes: requests today please ! what do you want to hear before your group starts presenting…. some sweet soulful :saxophone:? some head banging rock :the_horns:? :dancer: something with a little skirt swishing ? groovy disco tunes?:man_dancing::skin-tone-2:

otherwise teams will be allocated DJ Flo’s music choices… which may create some unexpected results …. fair warning given"
"<@U01RSRE0N3D> after the kahoot tomorrow, can you check with the students if their survey is available, and give them a few mins to complete the survey at the end of class before freeing them for the remainder of the day --- else i fear we will have a 10% completion rate this week :slightly_smiling_face:"
"will do!"
"Great to see some project submissions coming in ahead of the deadline! we have 5 students who have already submitted their project :heavy_check_mark:… does this mean they are chilling out in a park having a :coffee: and :doughnut: or just practicing their presentation to get it slick and smooth? :thinking_face:
Anyway well done to everyone who either has submitted or is getting close. Looking forward to seeing all of your project Repos!"

"Good criteria to check out the robustness of the models is to look at the asteriks of each variable. The more asterisks, the lower the p-value and the larger the probability that that independent varible explains the dependent one."

He does not cook, im afraid, Isabel… but he will prompt my aunt Leri to cook for him now he is vegan…
he loves all and any books, he will treasure whatever you come up with but one suggestion from me would be - take a photo of the whole class doing bear hugs and send it to him with an email and comments from some of you. it wont cost a thing, and he isnt really into packaging and plastic waste as you can imagine"

"morning, folks. What was the Repo-sample for our project?"
"in the solutions section, what is the < |stale.yml> file for /how is it opened/launched :face_with_rolling_eyes:"
"I did not find it. But yml is an extension for the python environment. It shows the requeriment (libraries and their versions) we need to run the project."
"not relevant  for students. Only for the Ironhack education team internally."
"I found it now. Don’t worry about it and other files inside .github . They are usually hidden (with dot in the beginning of the name),  they are important only to the autor of the repository."
"btw... that's also not the solutions section:slightly_smiling_face:"
"yes you are in the actual lab section Neil! if you remember, we share the solutions with you via Notion - if the solutions were stored right next to the lab that would be quite boring for us all!"
"Software and Hardware setup requirements for this week (unit2):
• Monday - no additional setup needed, you will be primarily working on your project - in python/ pandas/numpy. Ensure you can actively participate in your group by testing your audio/ video on zoom. If this is not possible on your laptop, try the zoom app on your phone or tablet
• Tuesday - zoom - as we have class presentations in the morning, any and all of you should be able to share your screen. Please enable/ test this, plus testing audio functionality / internet speed tests as appropriate eg < |test zoom>, < |test speed> 
• Tuesday lecture and labs - we will be using jupyter notebook with numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries. Nothing new to install but check that your chosen conda environment (if you are using conda) works with matplotlib and seaborn or use your base jupyter environment. 
• Wednesday + Thursday we all will need tableau public (minimum) or tableau desktop (optional) 2021 version. I have given you a lab for tuesday afternoon to complete this setup. I would recommending using the quickstart (same lab) to ensure your laptops can cope with tableau and zoom. Unfortunately tableau is memory hungry and there are minimum tech specs listed < |here> - the alternative on the day will be to work on a browser version, so do let us know if you are struggling with your hardware/RAM so we can prepare for this. 
• Friday- we will return to Python and will be using numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn + < |sci-kit_learn> which will require an install on your chosen python env"

if you finish the `Lab | Customer Analysis Round 2` you will realize that the date column contains only entries for January and February. So obviously the exercise to filter for Jan/Feb/Mar is a bit dull.

So I overwrote the month number in the csv with random integers. You can give that csv a try, if you want to have it a bit more spiced up :grin:"
"Should we then make a copy of our Jupyter Notebook with Customer Analysis Round 2 and then read marketing_customer_anlysis_x.csv there? :slightly_smiling_face:"
"no, not necessary :grin:
just if you want to play around with another dataset that is a bit more exciting with respect to the tasks.
and don't use my data for the coming Labs please, for consistency"
Oki!
thanks!
"Ok, the dataset will give you an error if you solved the lab properly. Here's why: I subsituted the month part of the values in that `effective_to_date` column randomly with values between 1 and 12. So far so logical. But then also date values with for example ""7/31/11"" got the 7 subsituted for a 2, which would make it February the 31st, which doesn't exist and since pandas datetime is smart, it will throw you an error like this (screenshot). So, better not use my data :grin:, or: *Bonus quest*: Fix my data so that for all Februaries the days are valid :nerd_face:"

Regarding the upcoming Lab `Customer Analysis Round 3` : I inspected it and reworked the instructions. Please take the same data, but take these instructions:

&gt; For this lab, we still keep using the `marketing_customer_analysis.csv` file. You can find the file in the `files_for_lab` folder.
&gt; 
&gt; *Get the data*
&gt; Use the same jupyter file from the last lab, `Customer Analysis Round 3`
&gt; 
&gt; *EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) - Complete the following tasks to explore the data:*
&gt; * Show DataFrame info.
&gt; * Describe DataFrame.
&gt; * Show a plot of the total number of `response`s broken down by response kind.
&gt; * Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by the total claim amount.~ Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind. Try a boxplot and distribution plot, for each `response` kind. For the distribution plot, try to plot both kinds of responses in one chart (you can try with seaborn's histplot, using the `hue` parameter).
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by income.~ Create similar plots like in the task before, but for `Income`
&gt; * *NEW*: Create a scatterplot between `total claim amount` and `income`. Play around with the parameters of the scatterplot (markersize? alpha?) and try to identify more features within the data just visually. You can also try different seaborn plots. Check to find suitable ones: < "
"Hey, so Im still not getting how to get my data from Git hub into Jupyter, clone then pull..anybody else still having problems with this? maybe a TA could walk me through it"
"I am on it"
"let me know if someone else needs help"
"* Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.

is only the response=""yes"" that count as response? or is either response=yes, no a response?"
"It actually means 'number of responses broken down 1st by response kind, 2nd by response channel'"
"So, number of responses on the y axis, response kind on the x-axis, and then the bars for the both responses again split by the sales channel"
understood!
"me too... but watching the GitHub link that Tony shared is on my to do list:

"Thanks, Kosta walked me through it, but Ill watch this too"
"The Video from <@U01RXCQHMHT> was very helpful :clap:"
"for this:

&gt; Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind.
trying to use
`sns.boxplot(x = 'Response',y = 'total_claim_amount', file1=file1)`
`plt.show()`

but I always get errors for the column names:

""Could not interpret input 'Response'"" :thinking_face:  ... did I not install Seaborn properly?"
"the `.boxplot()` doesn't have a parameter called `file1`. you must provide `data` instead, So...
```sns.boxplot(x = 'Response',y = 'total_claim_amount', data=your_dataframe)```"
"still the same when I add the name of my dataframe :confused:"
"sns.histplot(data=file, x=""Total Claim Amount"", hue=""Response"", multiple=""stack"")"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> hi Flo, this return AttributeError : module 'seaborn' has no attribute 'displot'"
nan
"Do you have any idea why?"
"Yes, in the newest version of seaborn, they begin to ditch the `distplot` and start aggregating all the distribution plots under `displot()`  (missing the ""t""). `displot` is contained in seaborn version 0.11.1, so in case you get that error, you might want to open another git bash window, activate your current environment and do
```conda update seaborn```"

"its true, for interviews as data analyst or data scientist roles, you will very often be sent a test on your SQL and python skills which looks a lot like this. one of the best skills is figuring out how to work with this software!"

"So what's the point?"
"well i think you are slightly misunderstanding it… with pandas, for example, we might have a few different ways of solving a problem. but the kind of challenge on code wars is more absolute - for example todays challenge, write a function, that can handle the introduction of an integer and then provide a response if its odd or even - one of the tests will be did you write a function"
"and your solution is not a python function"
"but it also said write a script"
"define a function means getting something like :
def test_function(argument1) :
  # Do something with the code, and the argument.
  print(argument1)

# Calling the function."
"""Create a function (or write a script in Shell)"""
"oh i see where you got that from now! makes more sense …"
"I proceeded with the latter"
"if we've made multiple errors on the work do we still upload them? asking for a friend"
"ah got it… but it still isnt a shell function right?"
"Well, I'm new to this. Is what i wrote a script?"
"oh no its not - its a logical argument i believe.
maybe im misunderstanding, but i imagine if you had the full shell script it would have passed the tests.
But as flo said, you can also see what kind of tests are being pushed on your code… like are decimals being introduced, or 0s - whatever kind os stretch test to ensure the code is good."
"this is a bit of info about shell scripting < "
"and this about building functions in python < "
"these might help! but also know we will do much more of this in class through the course"
"soon it will feel more familiar :slightly_smiling_face:"
"and there are still a few ways of doing the same thing - dont worry! if you look at the solutions on code wars you will see things like
```def even_or_odd(number):
    return 'Odd' if number % 2 else 'Even'```
and
```def even_or_odd(number):
  if number % 2 == 0:
    return ""Even""
  else:
    return ""Odd""```
which return the same output but are structured differently!
• one thing to remember is you wont see a lot of print() on code wars as successful solutions - a little tip :wink:"
"yes i think thats the best approach actually"
"you can always update the notebooks in github later, but for now, it means we can have a look at how youre getting on and where those errors are coming up"
"What is the purpose of functions in Data Analytics? To test models, for example?"
"A linear regression?"
"ooh good question…. functions are effectively used to do tasks either repeatedly or robustly (applying rules, arguments, transformations)… you may remember in class that we wrote a clean function to tidy up the gender column, but theres a tonne of ways we could use a function in a data analysis process, from cleaning, through EDA, to predictive modelling. heres a cool example of a function you can use right now
def histograms_numeric_columns(df, numerical_columns):
    ‘’'
    Takes df, numerical columns as list
    Returns a grid of histograms
    ‘’'
    f = pd.melt(df, value_vars=numerical_columns)
    g = sns.FacetGrid(f, col=‘variable’,  col_wrap=4, sharex=False, sharey=False)
    g = g.map(sns.distplot, ‘value’)
    return g
….this is a time saver function…. instead of making a bunch of separate histograms, return all your columns as a grid of histograms. we can look at this in the morning if you like ?"
"a linear regression is a model, rather than a function, and we will start using them next friday :slightly_smiling_face:"
"ok, Sian already answered while I was typing. :grin:

The function serves the purpose to be able to ""atomize"" tasks. (Not only) in data analytics, we're facing the problem to be just overwhelmed by the task in front of us. So the general approach is: break the task into smaller tasks, which then get broken down again into smaller tasks etc.... and for the lowest ones, you would write a function, solve that problem, and then go one level up, reusing that function and solve the problem on the next higher difficulty level (related to _First Principles thinking_ I guess).

In practical terms, when it comes to code, this has the advantange that your code is - as Sian said -
• *scalable* (you don't need to reinvent the wheel at higher levels),
• your code is *reusable* for yourself and others,
• your code is *outsourcable* when you put it in functions*,* out of a notebook for example, to keep your Notebook clear and reduced to only the things you want to show (most of the time, it's the results). You would then import it as we import e.g. pandas right now, `from my_module import my_function` (we can have a workshop on that)
•  it's *robust.* if one function fails to do the job, it may break, but the rest of the code may continue running. You can even implement Error handling in exactly that function to get information in case of an error, why it failed (comes later in the bootcamp, crucial for example in _Webscraping_)
• it's easier to maintain / repair / upgrade. Dependencies are much easier to handle etc.
• Personal feeling: It feels nicer in my head to solve a problem piece by piece
Of course, all of this is merely theoretical at this point but as tasks become more and more complex, you're starting to whish for functions :slightly_smiling_face:"

"I come from an Economics background. There a function is something like ""Y = C + I + (G - T) - (X - M)"", which is the function for GDP"
"You don't authomatize things there"
"So its another mindfrime"
*mindframe
"For me the course until now has been a combination of completely easy stuff with other things that I still fail to grasp"
"well, I would say, functions in a programming world are conceptually not really different compared to your example.... in python it would maybe be something like this:
```def get_gdp(c, i, g, t, x, m):
  y = c + i + (g - t) - (x - m)
  return y```
they also just mimic the concept of functions in math as a relation between two sets (elements of set X are associated with exactly one element of set Y). With the difference in programming being that functions can perform so much more that just project from one set to another"

"i had some feedback from Hang on the stages of the career tasks and the deadlines :
*Hang*  [09:17]
Hey @sian d, thanks for raising it! I gave them 2 deadlines.

• Sunday, week 3 - Having applied all suggestions from Careerhack  stage 1 on their linkedin &amp; CV (without activating the optimisation tool, resumeworded)
• Sunday, week 7 - Having optimised their linkedin &amp; CV WITH resumeworded to a score of at least 70
[09:19] the reason why i split this is because they only have a 60 premium access to resumeworded, which I want them to activate in the 2nd half of their bootcamp.

So after the deadline week 3, I am doing a workshop in week 4 on wednesday evening to already give them an understanding what recruiters look out for. Weeks 4-7 are more for optimisation because that’s also when the bootcamp starts getting busier.
[09:21] let me know if this is clear, I do understand that this staged process can be a bit confusing - will make it clearer for the next bootcamp."

 :microscope: *regarding the today's labs (after lecture/lunch)*
please stick to these ""improved"" instructions (and not the ones you find under the github link):

• *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.5*
1. Select all the actors with the first name ‘Scarlett’.
2. How many films (movies) are available for rent and how many films have been rented?
3. What are the shortest and longest movie duration? Return the results as columns with the names  `max_duration` and `min_duration`.
4. What's the average movie duration expressed in format (hours, minutes) Return the result as columns with the names `hours` and `minutes`?
5. How many distinct (different) actors' last names are there?
6. Since how many days has the company been operating (check the `DATEDIFF()` function)? Hint: rental table
7. Show all rental information with additional columns `month` and `weekday`. (hint: `DATE_FORMAT()` ). Get 20 results.
8. Add an additional column `day_type` with values _'weekend'_ and _'workday'_ depending on the rental day of the week.
9. How many rentals were made in the last month of renting activity?
.... stay tuned, improved instructions for the other labs will maybe follow"
"<!channel>,
:microscope: for *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.6*
please use these instructions

1. Get the unique release years.
2. Get all films with _ARMAGEDDON_ in the title.
3. Get all films which title ends with _APOLLO_.
4. Get 10 the longest films.
5. How many films include *Behind the Scenes* content?
6. Drop column `picture` from `staff`.
7. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.
8. Add a rental for movie ""Academy Dinosaur"" by the customer ""Charlotte Hunter"" from employee Mike Hillyer at Store 1. You can use current date for the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table. *Hint*: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there. You can query those pieces of information in other tables. For eg., you would notice that you need `customer_id` information as well. To get that you can use the following query: 
```select customer_id from sakila.customer
where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER';```
Use similar method to get `inventory_id`, `film_id`, and `staff_id`.

9. *(Optional, you can skip this)* Delete non-active users, but first, create a _backup table_ `deleted_users` to store `customer_id`, `email`, and the `date` (use `CURDATE()` , < |link>) for the users that would be deleted. Follow these steps:
    ◦ Check if there are any non-active users
    ◦ Create a table _`backup table`_ as suggested
    ◦ Insert the non active users in the table _`backup table`_
    ◦ Delete the non active users from the table _`customer`_"
"OOF! we covered a lot of ground this morning with SQL. :exploding_head:
…………….I feel the labs this afternoon will give you space and time to try out all of those things we covered today at your own pace. Here are some extra resources I have checked out already, that you might want to bookmark/ walk through;  to embed some of the practices from earlier, and in the case of DDL+ DML - to get some more context for how to use them and practice with, as we ran out of time today :
• < |most common string functions> and how they are used 
• regex in mysql using the keyword < |REGEXP>
• < |dates and formatting of dates eg D%>
• < |tutorial on dates with create, insert + date_add, date_sub, date_diff> 
• < |Nulls v empty> 
• using logic in queries : < |CASE STATEMENTS> and < |IF () function> 
• DML commands : < |UPDATE> and < |INSERT INTO>  
• DDL commands: < |CREATE, ALTER, DROP> (use with caution!) "

_Why would I need that?_
• absolutely *no* requirement for a Data Analyst role
• if at all, used in the Data Science field
• to get a deeper understanding of how Python works (what's all the fuss about `class` es in Python?)
• to tip your toes into techniques on how to make code scalable, more easily maintanable - and in the end, solve problems more elegantly

"As one of our follow up actions from yesterdays poll :

• for this weeks GNOD project - I have put a very simple minimum viable product together in jupyter notebook which takes a user input (song name) and compares it to the top 100 to provide a song recommendation. This is for the first product image (shown in the notebook) and can be adapted to the names / columns of your own top 100 variables.
• in addition, this could, of course, be extended for the second version of the product (the spotipy songs+ features, kaggle database, unsupervised clustering) , and can be added to by modularising the scraping code, recommender function, spotipy code etc 
i will be available in a breakout room later this afternoon for a q&amp;a on how to use this template."

I love the background colour and all the white space you’ve chosen to go for  - i think it makes it look nice and clean. Also you have gone for very minimal labels - its a style i haven’t seen before---im not 100% with you :slightly_smiling_face: , but i like the way you have executed that. Good choice of simple colour scheme, not overwhelming.
• it would be nice if the profit filter controlled the other charts too - so we saw the top customer list and category view change. 
• also it would be nice if the category filter controlled more than one chart
• the lollipop chart needs a little work - looks to me, when furniture is selected, as if the axes arent snyc’d anymore, as the circle  is somehow offset from the bar (not a problem on office supplies), but also the bars and circles could be adjusted to align better. Typically the top of the lollipop is bigger than the width of the bar.
• check your map- in line with my rule of users will do anything you dont want them to, i could zoom out on the map - I normally turn off that zoom or switch to pan mode when publishing a map
• i really like that the map filters the other charts - but you could edit those tooltips to make them look nicer / be more relevant "

"its a bit visually busy - one way you make it less so is working on removing and labels, particularly axis labels that are unnecessary to the story. sometimes you can get away with a good tooltip and remove the axis altogether.
Good job with the floating legends and filters though, plus i quite like the bottom left bar chart labels."
"i think it would be better if the charts were interactively linked, as at the moment they are just placed… something to work on for the future"
"and it is pretty. I like that you used floating legends and filters to make better use of the space, that you chose a title which is a ‘call to action’ - encouraging people to dive in and explore the data themselves.
I agree with the colours - be careful that people dont assume the same shade of purple means the same thing in two places but nice use of colour background and outlines - if im being fussy the boxes are not quite aligned here"
"but overall good job! this dashboard is not overwhelming :slightly_smiling_face:
Maybe something to work on is the interaction between the charts"
"I agree with Thamo, nice idea to show the lapsed customers in a staggered kind of bar chart :slightly_smiling_face: i would consider the placement of your two colour legends on the right… i feel like you dont need the legend for RFM rc tier as you have the headers in the chart itself. The other legend (the customer segments) you could show the names of the segments in the bar chart and lose that legend too, or float it, in the white space above the big yellow bar.
In general its a good idea to avoid axis which make us have to turn our heads sideways :owl:- theres one axis label doing that now, on your rfm rc tier bar chart.
nice job on the comments - try making that font bold and a bit bigger?
agree with Marian -  put white font on the grey header blocks- i would even add a matching grey outline to the charts to hold it all together
overall - great job!"
"really nice layout Olubunmi! i like the consistent use of colours bar chart to line chart - as a consequence i would avoid using blue again on the map, to save any visual confusion. good size font for the titles, its clear and easy to use.
consider changing the filters from multi select drop down to single button select - this avoids anyone unticking all options and ending up with nothing to look at! We can talk about different options for placing your filters… the truth is they can go anywhere!"
"stepping up with a movie version! nice one :slightly_smiling_face:
i like that youve used a srong, bold font for your titles and considered sizing for an intuitive layout. Its a nice layout too, very logical, and i like the colours.
you seem to have an issue in the filters top right - they are too squashed, so maybe go back and give it more space when you can"
"its great that your region filter affects everything, but the date filter only changes the map, which could be a bit confusing because thats not near the map, its at the top of the dashboard - i would expect it to filter everything.
nice use of a floating legend for the map. when publishing a map its a good idea to turn the zoom functionality off so your end users dont end up really zoomed out"
"not quite the dashboard lab we were working on but ok!
without legends on the scatter plots having the multiple trend lines are hard to interpret - can you think about adding legends , having just one trend line , and instead of lots of small coloured circles which clash with the trend line, you could potentially eliminate all the extra colours or have one grey trend line. Once a scatter plot gets visually busy its worth switching from shape to circles, which can be faded, and show the density better with an outline, so I would have  think about that.
nice use of the bold blue headings - watch out for the _condition of property_ axis, its quite squeezed and the label doesnt fully display on my laptop- in fact you can drop the axis labels i think as each scatter contains the same information on x and y"
"hi thanks for the feedback, I will review my dashboard, I used this data so Id complete my project file"
"yeah I agree with Neil you might want to turn the zoom control off :slightly_smiling_face: we are too used to google maps arent we :slightly_smiling_face:
i like the floating layout, making best use of your space. I would drop the grid lines from the bar charts to keep the whole look clean, or do the same as you did with the lollipop chart - looks like they are really faded out.
Did you consider creating a dashboard title ? it feels sort of lost without it.

the profit legend could go further up the map, nearer to the view title, the category legend is possible unnecessary - something to be careful of - that legend is placed next to california at the moment, which also is blue - suggesting california is furniture, so consider your colour choices.

with so much space going for the  map i think you need to have more information on your tooltip, maybe a viz in tooltip ? but certainly clean the tooltips up a bit!"
"nice, simple three part grid structure - i think it would look neater if you had turned off the grid lines, put a title on the dashboard to bring it all together. I would recommend you to revise and test your dashboard actions … i dont think this is what you wanted to happen"

< #!/vizhome/recyclingandbeer/RecyclingBeer>

I too was messing with that London recycling set… on the < |thread above> there was talk of adding bars on each borough…but…. i cant figure it out. ‘Bars’ gives me HUGE bars on each borough (all the same height and just varying by width….not ideal)… Gantt chart gives me teeny tiny bars of the same(ish) size.

Which formatting option am I not seeing?"
"yes colour and layout are not ideal…started getting too creative with backgrounds…. and the beer prices were in pence, took me a while to get them into pounds with the right symbol :neutral_face:"
"uhhh i LOVE the bier icon!!!"
"but yes the bars look very funny that way, like a raining cloud. Would be interesting to know how to change that scale."
"<@U01RN7BVD1C> i’m having doubts over the data quality….cant remember a London beer ever being that cheap :thinking_face:

unless the figures are taken from a < |Sam Smiths pub>"
"hahaha yeah thats quite cheap, nearly berlin euro prices hmm"
<@U01RW140HBP>
"wow ! quite the bar chart over map combo lol
so what I can see quickly is that although you have Year in your beer data, I cant see any evidence you have london borough, in your beer data - hence the price of beer would be the same for all parts of london - is that what you expected ?  price ranges from 2.26 in 2003/4 to 3.70 in 2019/20, which does feel cheap for london!

as to your visualisation, you are using the size of bars, over the top of the map - but this is duplicated encoding, because you have created a copy of latitude, then changed the display of latitude to bars, even though its just displaying the same information as on the original map.
what are you trying to show on the map ? because if i strip the bars away we just have a map and beer, then it makes sense"
nan
"and well done for getting the beer icon in there and making the beer grow over time… i think if you could get an average price by borough (no idea where from) or a london beer price (i think this must be nationwide) then this would be great stuff!"
"oops…. yes… now I see the beer prices are from the ONS, so will be nationwide:

< | 

per borough would be fun, but a challenge :joy: …having it just for london was the plan

I'm just trying to show some bars on each borough…. shorter ones for lower numbers, taller ones for higher numbers…mainly for the lolz

using latitude twice came from here… but their bars on the US map example look sensible :thinking_face:

Interesting to see here:
• low prices come in all conditions and grades (referring to sub 200k)
• High prices usually have a condition of 3+ AND a grade of 4+
• There’s no high grade-low condition-cluster (I assumed this, and it is true)
• Very high condition and very high grade correlate to higher prices, but are likely not the cause of them"

“You should end up with 3 new dimension (blue) columns per customer - test these out in a view with a subset of customer ids”

so 3 per customer on each metric? i.e. they’re in tier 1 but not in tier 2, not in tier 3?"

"i love the comments and insights Karina! and the colour scheme is also very pleasing. I think its a bit of a busy dashboard, particularly because the box plots are a little visually busy - but its really well constructed and the questions are all great

things i would consider changing - i dont think you need the category legend because we can see it in the top left chart - removing that legend would eliminate the whitespace. and do you need the axis labels and scales on the box plots ? i think that could be dropped too"
"also… though i love the colours - you do need to be careful with the same colour being used more than once to mean different things… pink means technology and high sales :rainbow:"

"i like this! - fresh approach - nice header colour too! theres a lot in here… i wonder if its a bit busy and you might need to more selective about what you include. but i like the big bubble chart as a global filter for the dashboard - its nice to have big buttons to click on - however i wonder if you can get away without using a title for this view, because its kind of intuitive, and eliminate  some whitespace ? plus, do you intend that if someone clicks on a bubble the other charts change ? it does work, but i wonder if you intend to show this at the end …"
nan
"there are a lot of colours on here- maybe rethink how many colours you want to include in one dashboard - you could use a viz in tooltip or a drill down dashboard instead  - plus, using purple in the header as well as in the rfm segmention ‘lapsed valuable’ could be misinterpreted as purple means x…"
"i like the instructions though and the layout feels quite untuitive, just busy. one way to make it less busy - remove any unnecessary axis labels and titles"
"thank you!!"
welcome!
"fire! theres a fire! good work Francisco. this dashboard is really quite sophisticated in the insights and visually balanced - youve done a good chunk of statistical analysis here and dug into the why, of what makes westminster an outlier. I like the colour scheme (goes well with the fire theme) though i would think about a different colour for the scatter plot- maybe a brown, so it stands out but not too much. also a great use of a polynomial trend line! i hadnt spotted that :slightly_smiling_face:
some tips - i think you could get away without the label ‘borough name’ at least on one of the charts - because its quite intuitive. the chart on the bottom right - i feel like you need a better header that doesnt run out of space.  - maybe something short like ‘popln / borough’
everything else is tidy, but rather than being an interactive dashboard its more of a infographic, because youve answered the questions. It would have been nice to see some interactive pieces with an end user in mind"
"You did a good job. I would remove the stacked columns in the middle (or place them elsewhere,, if they are important) and patternize the colors..."

"<@U01RW140HBP> what I'd prefer to display when clicking on the bubbles is highlighting each of them in the rest of the graphs (so instead of changing the graphs, just highlighting their part but keeping the same graphs) i'm not sure if it's possible or even useful :sweat_smile:"
"thats what I would have suggested too! so instead of using that chart as a filter for everything, you can set up a dashboard action - highlight action, and highlight the charts you want"

"Thanks Kosta :slightly_smiling_face:"
"as a reminder, here is what you need to have prepared"
Welcome!
"i did say a 1 minute pitch, kosta"
"was gonna say….5 minutes is a big elevator :smile:

random looks very alphabetical haha"
"one of those skyscrapers in dubai ?"
"please stand by
< "
"for the first time ever i'm called top of a list that's arranged alphabetically, my surname starts with S :'("
"There is something I'm still struggling to understand with multiclass classification (or with classification problems in general). The output array, which is actually a quiet large one, is a list of likely predictions. It is used to construct the classification model's metrics. Correct? is there a hierarchy between those values? In the sense that the first value of the array is the more likely one?"
"I feel you Alex, I’m also usually the last :smile:"
"probably more a question for <#C01S58JN5FT|lab-help>. But anyway...
Yeah, mostly correct. Although there's no hierarchy.

The output (let it be `y_predict` ) is an array with values of the different ""classes"" (like the four flower species in the iris dataset). It is of equal length as the feature dataframe (let it be `X_test` ) which you put in the model to predict them. The metrics for classification (< |True negatives, True positives, False negatives, False positives, accuracy score, F1 error, F2 error, accuracy, precision, recall>, ... ) are then calculated (or directly observable in the confusion matrix) by comparing `y_predict` with `y_test` . The latter is the _Truth,_ the first is the _predicted._ One basically looks for every pair of `y_predic` and `y_test` , how many are there of each combination? And then the confusion matrix is nothing but a tally chart of those possible combinations of the two arrays and in a best case scenario you only have matching pairs, which results in the fact that TN's and TP's are maximized.

So, to answer your last question: No, the order of the predicted label array `y_predicted` doesn't contain any hierarchy. It's just what your model has predicted for every corresponding line of your input dataframe"
"Thanks! No, its not for the lab..."
"I'm trying to understand this for the final project"
"That explanation was on point... I needed to understand where the number of output points came from... Thanks again!"
"yey it worked! just takes ages to scrape all top100 songs for all weeks from 2000-2021 :girl-grin:"

"Hi guys, I am trying to iterate though dates without success. My goal is to send one request to this api to get data foe each day in a range of time but I am getting and error. Can you see what I am doing wrong? Thank you:slightly_smiling_face:"
"Hey guys, maybe someone is free now, so I’ll give it a try: I’m trying to concat df’s from which some doesn’t have the same amount of columns as the other one, but most of their columns will match (the values will be different, so I need them to be copied one below each other). I want to fill in the columns which some of them lack with NaN values in the result df. I tried every parameter, none of them returns what I need. :disappointed:

"check this in the documentation, it shows many many ways that you can combine dataframes"
"yeah.. I tried through almost all"
"did you try to ignore the index?"
nan
"i think you are trying an outer join right?"
"if columns are not same in all tables"
"can I show you what I mean in a breakout room maybe? it’s a bit hard to explain in writing :stuck_out_tongue:"
"i think you need to union your dataframes rather than merge = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)
• do this after setting the column names consistently across the frames. 
• get it right for two data frames before trying multiple data frames in one go 
happy to join you if alex cant help, but im sure he can"
"Hey Lilla. Looks like you got a solution - this sounds like a similar issue that was doing my head in all weekend :see_no_evil:.
If you are struggling maybe consider joining the  JSON files first (then to DataFrame afterwards). This is how I did it - but it wasn't pretty"
"Thanks both! Solved it with Alex, it was an outer join with index set to False - what I did already but to test I was checking the .head instead of .shape. Maybe more coffee will do  :sweat_smile:"
"haha coffee and food needed then- well done Lilla and <@U01RW2X7S9Z>"
"Hi, I’m having this error when importing csv to mysql. How should I deal with NaN values?"
"have you tried configuring the columns to allow nulls ?"
"Hi! Why is this happening? I have a range."

"if you want to iterate over a dataframe i suggest using df.iterrows() instead"
"what do you want to get in the end?"
"for the length of df.fruits_veggies i want to get the results 1 or 2 or 3 saved in body_score"
"ah ok it is wrong…this is probably adding to body score all the time :see_no_evil: but i want  a list"
"```for index, row in df.iterrows():
    if row[index of your fruit_veggies column] &lt; 2:
         do this```"
"and you probably want to append to the list and not sum it up :slightly_smiling_face:"
"you can use directly the column going for fruit in df['fruits_veggies']:
if fruit &lt;2:
and so on"
"like you dont need to user range len df if you iterate directly on the column"
"lol i’ve been iterrowing this whole time, thanks alex!
His solution is most likely quicker"
"i guess iterrows is good and faster if you need to operate on several columns for each operation, i haven't used it yet"
"that works!! Thanks to both of you :pray::blossom:"

"<@U01RW140HBP> is there a way to use max as window function without partition? I was experimenting and trying to filter results where return_date is equal to max return_date. something like:
 select *,
from sakila.RENTAL;
where EXTRACT(MONTH FROM return_date) = max ( EXTRACT(MONTH FROM return_date))"
"i would do this with a self join… hold that thought"
"so the challenge you have here is you cant use the window function as part of the where clause due to the order of execution … they are created in the Select, so cant also be used in Select:
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
this gets you half of the way there… in real life I would normally run the query *select max(return_date) from rental* first, spot that the max month is 9 and then just hard code 9 into my code :
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) = 9* 
…. however to do it programmatically, rather than manually, involves either a subquery or a self join - subquery would be the better way to go.
*select * , month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) =* 
*( select month(max(return_date))  from rental)*
here the subquery is the same as i started with …

a self join method is actually too messy (i tried a few versions) !"
"try using use sakila ;
then your INSERT INTO statement. But i think you will find there are some constraints on the table which require inserting more information than you have here. if you check the create statement for this table you will see we cant have null entries for
*first name* 
*last name* 
*address id* 
*store id* 
*user name.*
what this means is you will get an error if you try to partially fill a record not completing all those cells.
to get all that information, because we know Tammy is already a customer, you can query her records
*SELECT * FROM sakila.customer*
*where first_name = ‘Tammy’*
then you can amend your insert into statement to include that info
*insert into sakila.staff(first_name, last_name,  address_id, store_id, username)*
*values(‘TAMMY’,‘SANDERS’, 79, 2, ‘tammy’)*
if this doesnt make sense lets jump in a breakout room and go through it later!
*actually the user name is made up…. ‘tammy’ which is not obvious* "
"where is often easier ! and you can combine where with a subquery (we will go through this in tomorrows lecture) so that is flexible. However i normally use joins where i want fields from more than one table."
"if your database is clean, all tables have good referential integrity (ie no missing actor_id), it doesnt matter … in general i suggest to start a join with the transactional table but we dont really have transactions in this join between actors and the bridge table, so it could be done either way."

"might be helpful to know how big the bing tiles are - normally the small unit of change captured is 4km square or so …"

“In a similar way now, create a function that takes a list of artist names and return their 50 first appearances as a dictionary”

I am iterating over the 607 ID’s provided, but after ~1100 songs i get this error"

"super!! mine is running now too :cool-doge:"
"Remember to drop duplicates afterwards :rocket:"
"A question:
I want to zip 2 lists into a dict. However in my dict I only get 1 value pair. When i zip the 2 lists into a new list, I get all the entries.
How do I get all the value pairs in my dict?"
"called it a day at 10k"
"you can try to iterate to see if it works:
{key:value for key,value in zip(owner,id)}"
"with a dict comprehension"
"but wait the issue there is that your keys are not unique, you have to flip them around"
"so spotify should be the value and the id is the key"
"you are getting a 1 key dictionary because dictionaries only allow unique keys, and you only have one there: spotify"
"ahhhhhh now it all makes sense :slightly_smiling_face: thank you alex!!"
"just annoying that I need them this way around to put them into the sp.user_playlist_tracks() function"
"as you said the films are rented multiple times- because the query includes rental dates, there will be multiple copies of inventory id returned in the results. to group up to the inventory id level you must use a group by + aggregation. try aggregating using MAX  or MIN rental date - whatever makes more sense for your query, and group by inventory_id"

"Thanks! will maybe have a go this afternoon"
okydoky!
"so a granular histogram is just counting the unique values… you would only see a count of more than 1 (ie a bar above average length) where the same exact value was replicated across multiple cities. I wonder if thats likely in this data set ?
most of the time in the histograms created in python you are systematically ‘binning’ the data points, as in grouping up the values into buckets, so you should see a bar in your histogram which covers similar values, ie the first bar might account for  all the values between 50 and 58, and the next bar would be all values between 58 and 66 .. try experimenting with the bin size as this might help it make more visual sense to you
< 
eg --&gt; df.hist(bins=8)"

it also explains some of the things I was talking about today in different ways and uses a case study that is easy to follow:
• Let’s pretend you work for the company that manufactures and markets a widget
• The company might ask you the following: On the basis of this data, how should we spend our advertising money in the future?
• This general question might lead you to more specific questions:
    a. Is there a relationship between ads and sales?
    b. How strong is that relationship?
    c. Which ad types contribute to sales?
    d. What is the effect of each ad type of sales?
    e. *Given ad spending in a particular market, can sales be predicted?*"
"<@U01S133DZ9A> thought this might be useful for you < 
there is only one variable X in this case, the no of hours studied, but you can better see how the model is evaluated by how closely it predicts y, the % score achieved - where we are fairly sure of a linear relationship (the more i study, the better i do in a test)"

"ok great, thanks, I have installed MySQL, so I just need the set up steps"
"One quick series of steps to try with MySQL and the dump file…
• open your MySQL client and create a new connection, to your local mysql instance - with your uname and password, port 3306
• once the sql dump file is downloaded, do a right click and open with your mysql client 
• run the query - this creates a bank database and populates it with the data
• if you get data on the screen when you run *select * from bank.account* you are good to go :tada:"

"Hi, folks. How can I check and count the occurrence of values in two Series (columns)?
This question came from our project. I have this code

`df.groupby(""location"", sort=False)[""position""].apply(`
     `lambda df: df.str.contains(""Data Analyst"").sum()`

"Split at whitespace is not possible?
Can you post an example? :blush:"
"i understand the confusion !

if you want to hop on a breakout room and talk it through let me know.
One way to think about averages/counts:
if i do a *select count(column) from table* - i will get one value back - think of *select count(student_name) from bootcamp* - the answer is 23.
same rule applies with *select avg(age) from bootcamp* - the answer is probably around 26
if i want to see more than one row i need to do a group by on each column that isn’t the value aggregated
*- select count(student_name), gender from bootcamp* 
*group by gender* 
would return male : 15 , female:8

I always start with joining the tables i need, select all the fields i want to use across the tables, then think about doing the aggregation using count/avg + groupby

However for qu 6 you are right that we can use one table, transactionhistory, because it has transaction ids and the date-- the challenge here is to extract the month and year for our group by."

You have to either overwrite `file3` with the output of that or use the `inplace=True` switch. Otherwise your changes won't be permanent. You just get an output shown, but no changes are made on the dataframe itself. So do something like

```file3 = file3.rename(columns={ 'state':'ST'})```
or
```file3.rename(columns={ 'state':'ST'}, inplace=True)```
I personally prefer the first solution, since not all pandas functions have an `inplace` parameter. And I'm too lazy to memorize which have, and which don't :grin:"

"so I saw that one of the requirements is to delete education and number of complaints columns in the lab and I did as asked but I don’t see that done in the solutions (and I’m not sure if they should be deleted, don’t we need them at all later?). should I delete those or just clean them?"
"ah! case sensitive. your `State` has a capital S"
"u should drop them in the final concatenated file, but not delete them in the original one.
We used `data = data.drop(['number_of_open_complaints'],axis=1)`

thanks!
"case sensitivity annoyed me yesterday as well ^^"

"Yes, I didn't do that in my solutions. But the official ironhack solutions have that (see that there are two notebook files). I instead chose to clean the `number of complaints` column and turn for example those `1/1/0` values into `1` ....
In case of doubt, follow the official Ironhack solutions, because the dataframes you get there at the end, are important for the next Lab. I just didn't see a reason why to drop `education` and `number of complaints`
 :slightly_smiling_face:

But then don't worry. The labs for this week are presented to you in a way that you always get the data with them as they should be processed up to this stage. So, if you couldn't follow with the previous Labs, you can just import the current csv's for that current Lab and work from there."

"Hi, folks. I have questions about Git/GitHub. <@U01SJKB2MG8> <@U01RW140HBP> <@U01RSRE0N3D>

• How can I edit the message of commits?"
"when modelling, how should we choose the value of `test_size` in sklearn? (`random_state` as I understand is just a random number, or?)"
"random state is the base for a randomly generated number, it is there to ensure consitency if I recall correctly.
regarding test_size, we went with 0.7 for testing and 0.3 for predicting, but our model isn’t the most precise"
"you recall correctly… so if you want to compare iterations <@U01RKN0EGDV> you should always use the same random_state (i generally use 40… theres no reason for it i just chose it early on, 100 is the one you often see)"
"the size of the train test split is kind of up to you. worth experimenting with a larger train set to see what impact it is… but to avoid overfitting to the train i normally choose a 60/40 or 70/30 split"
"so then we should have the same random_state in our iterations, but the test_size we can play with it, right?"
exactly!
"just to ensure the data is splitting randomly according to the same system, we keep the random state number the same, then the results are comparable. changing the split is independent of that, the results remain comparable"
"should there be a predict_size or is that calculated from what you put as test_size?"
"i think is calculated, 1- test_size, so just enter test_size"
"the predict size is related to the test size <@U01S7KCL3DF> --- if i have 1000 rows in my test data set (X_test) with n columns, then y_test will be also 1000 rows (one column) and the predictions will be 1000 rows long, one predicted value for each X_test row."

(in tableau there is always a way!)"
"thanks, Sian! This is the scatter plot I already have, based on the red lines. I want the columns associated with blue lines to also enter this single scatter plot.  At the end of the day, I would have a really big scatter plot with lots of dots coming from many columns."

"top of your data pane on the left sam, theres an icon looking like this …"
"this allows you to preview the data."
"but the workbook i gave you is sample superstore, so im not sure how this would have worked"
"however if you had removed the customer name filter (i had filtered to mick, michaels, mikes and michelles ) you WOULD find some customers who hadnt ordered anything for 166 weeks - so im tempted to suggest you have simply ripped out the customer name filter and your logic is actually correct"

"ahhh yes that’s it! didnt filter the names. oops"
"this icon to see a data overview in kind of a spreadsheet view..… was there also a way to go back and see the data in the same view as when you first pull in a csv file? did that ever exist?"
"yes on the data source page you have the same option. not however in the workbook you downloaded for class today, because the data source was effectively zipped up inside that workbook and therefore not viewable. but rest assured, normally you have that button next to your data source, yes"

I want to visualize if there is a visualizable relationship between the indicators and, respectively, exports and imports. Or in relation to GDO  I guess i will have to treat each sector as a category, like in the flower problem, and create large columns.

"yeah indeed"
"it comes down to *vectorized* operations (numpy, which does operations always on every element of the array *at once*) vs. some non vectorized ones in pandas. Although pandas builds heavily on numpy, meaning it benefits from that, there are certain ways you can use their API in which you accidentally loose this speed advantage... maybe with that `apply()` you have found one"

BUT how do I know the audio feature of the input song, if it e.g. not in my df with all the audio features?

hope this makes sense, maybe we can discuss in class after lunch..."
"i guess by function that gets the audio_features for that input track. but question is how to get track_id from track name because i couldnt find anything like that"
"we can use Alex’s giant database lol"
"Perhaps it would be more interesting if the initial input consisted of characteristics of the song, like a degree of danceability of funkiness."
"<@U01SJKB2MG8>, could we do that?"
"you would have to call the spotify api, but as I pointed out in the morning, the algorithm makes it hard to make sure you got the song the user wanted to have"
"<!channel>,
maybe a more clearer description about what the next step is for today. Start at *2.* Point *1.* is just to establish the link to the previous project steps.
1. Determine the audio features of the input song by querying the Spotify API with it. Store that result in a dataframe or numpy array (if the latter, keep track of which element in the array corresponds to which feature). Don't spend too much time on implementing any guessing that should be done by your program (whether user inputs the correct song). To get a working recommender ready, first assume that the user puts in a track name and/or an artist that *exactly matches* how they are stored in the spotify database.
2. take the vastness of songs you have collected together with their audio features and train a k-means model with them - similar how we did in lecture (scaling is important!). Keep in mind, that it doesn't make sense to train a model, when you have *artist* or *title* *name* or *track id* in the data. You need to however have the possibility to later (after your model has determined the cluster ids) reassign the correct *track ids* to the *rows. Y*ou can do this by just adding back the track id to the dataframe that contains the determined *cluster id's,* but of course only if you haven't shuffled your data rowwise. You can optimize a bit the parameters, but for a first iteration of your model, just go with the default values of KMeans and stick with it. Only improve later by tuning the parameters.
3. ""Predicting"" which *cluster id* a song belongs to, would work like this: take the audio-features of the song and put it into a numpy array, let's say `song_array`. The audio feature order must exactly match the order that the model has learned. Call the model with `KMeans.predict(song_array)` to make the prediction. The outcome is only one cluster
4. The recommendation would then work like this: Take the determined cluster id from *2.* and subset your spotipy dataframe to filter for this cluster with e.g. `df[df[""cluster_id'']==2]` and get a random song back from that subset. You can take a look at < |pandas.DataFrame.sample>"
"Hm yeah makes sense to use function to get track id from track name. Guess I have to search for that then as well.

And yes, we could also ask the user input a feature rather then a song ... 

Hm hm hm lots to do here"
"<@U01RRV4JX6Z> woulnt it then just be a lookup? theres no prediction really"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7> the database is still processing"
"i guess your program should call the spotify api  like thamo said and print back all the top suggestions and make the user choose somehow"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7> 11h28min in , 14 more expected"
"hope they dont block your ip haha"
"well i just assumed that they get more calls more often by other apps accessing their API.. hade some timeout errors yesterday but since then its just running!"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7>, the idea would be for the user to deliver some characteristics and the computer to randomly assign the user a song with these characteristics..."
"Predicting a song the user might light according to certain parameters"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> since I ran the data through the standardscaler, can I assume that if i get the data back from spotify i will directly get the right cluster or do I need to scale that data as well?"
"scale it please with the same trained scaler that you used for your training data.
And then its a good idea to take `.fit_transform(X)` apart and do fitting and transforming seperately. So you would do:
```scaler = Standardscaler().fit(X)

X_prep = scaler.transform(X)```
and then later:
```X_song_prep = scaler.transform(X_song)```
"
"why is that? :exploding_head:"
"the splitting part I mean"
"because you want to ""pipe out"" the trained scaler after you fit it and save it. If you do just

`X_prep  = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)`
you don't save it in a variable to be used later"
"that little `scaler` variable contains all the means and standard deviations for all your features and knows how to shift your features"
"The dumb thing is that the spotify df does not have song and artist name. Did i do something wrong?"
"if you only took the IDs, it doesnt have song and artist, i catched it in the step of pulling the song ID"
"the feature extractor does not have song and artist names"
"Via the procedure from monday?"
"in whatever is the step that gives you the song ids, before getting the features"
"but i think that for what we are trying to do, you might not need it?"
"Yeah, that's true, but it seems stupid, though"
"yeah, i guess it's just how they have their internal database set up"
"random question: is there a way to ""save"" a fitted model and import it straight away instead of having to make it learn again in further iterations?"
"yes. pickle it into a pickle < "
thanks!
"And more here:
< "
"pickle it - like preserve it ?"
"can someone help me with this error pls?"
"are the meaning and values of each audio feature somewhere?"
"< "
":smile: eurovision tho haha"
:female-singer:
thanks!!
"i dont know why, but try to change that k,2 to k,30"
"it mitght run but might not be a good result, im still understanding this"
"that doesnt work, dont listen to me! haha"
"maybe <@U01SJKB2MG8> can shine some light on what is being done there more specifically?"
"has anyone managed to get the audio features from a search?"
"you should be able to retrieve the ID of the song you searched, and then use the function to get the features"
"I can’t retrieve the ID"
"what does the search return?"
"a dictionary.
Then I access that dictionary;"
a[‘tracks’][‘items’]
"and that is a list, making it hard to navigate"
"go [0] and see where the id is"
"after tracks and items"
"id might be right there"
"You are an absolute hero, thank you!"
"no worries!"
"i just keep getting higher  silhouette score, the more clusters i add... i mean it doesn’t make sense to have that many clusters, does it?"
"it could! i think it is not very realistic to classify a lot of music tracks in 5 categories! I'm also wondering this so im runnning from 10 to 100 clusters"
"and see if there is a sweet spot in between"
"how many tracks are you working with?"
"Guys, did anybody got the same error while using 'KMeans.predict(song_array)'?"
"my 50k tracks are making me go sloooow"
"my laptop would die haha let me know which amout looks good for u. ill test it too"
"i have 35k"
"Alex, one more question, how did you unpack the features afterwards?"
"```

"got it, nevermind"
"looks like you didnt train the model, but not sure"
"if i have 51 clusters it splits all my songs in exacrly 699 songs per cluster :smile:"
"tested it and it seems, that piece of code there can't plot `k&gt;5` it seems. still figuring out why"
"ah... I see. It's because the figure is generated as 2 by 2 subplots and the way the plots for the clusters are assigned to the plot areas is determined by this `q, mod = divmod(k, 2)` and `ax=ax[q-1][mod]` expression.
Not really elegant because it only works for 2,3,4,5"
"Sorry to go back to an earlier issue, but: anybody work out how to get the song names ?"
"where are you stuck?"
"Playlist only has IDs - need the song name in our df as well"
"good point!"
"I managed to generate a working code in which, based on a first random recomendation, the computer selects  some more others that a similar to the randomly selected (building on the predictions made). When i replace ""random_song"" with ""filter_song"" in ""getCond = top_100[""cluster""][random_song]"", i get this error.:
```TypeError: Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column```
 Any ideas?"
"i dont get this. i need to add this one song to my whole song dataset and then scale it together? and then take it off again?"
"yeah i took that line off and plotted only the number of clusters i wanted to go for.. no good for comparative analysis but well"
"there is definitely something fishy there"
"yea i think i have some mistake somewhere because all of these 35k songs then correlate on 51 points"
"Once you scaled the data once, you want to save that scaling algo in a variable, so that the exact same scaling happens to new data.

Once you call the spotify api and get the features back, you want to run them through the saved scaler, not the original standardscaler, since using the original one would’nt return a result that is uniform with the scaled dataframe"
"this is because standardscaler takes mean and std and calculates the scaling from there, and that would look a lot different with only one datapoint compared to the whole dataframe"
"`scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)`"
"and next time you have to scale data you just call `scaler`"
"hope that made sense"
"Which datatypes are `top100` and `random_song` and `filter_song`?"
"top 100 is the dataframe"
"what you mean? I based this on Sian's code"

80 - ranked position 1 compared to itself

i am guessing you dont actually need a partition in this case. you can rank the films by length using :

*from sakila.film f*
*where length &lt;&gt; ' ' or length is not null;*"

perfect!
"i went for this...or do we want each film length to be the same rank?

i.e. all 46 minute films to be 1, all 47 minute films to be 2...etc etc

from film
where length is not null and length &lt;&gt; '';```"

`select title, length, Rank() over (order by length DESC) as 'Rank'`

`where length &lt;&gt; '';`"
exactly!

rank() over (partition by c.last_name order by count(r.rental_id) DESC) as noofrentals"

""6. Is the `Academy Dinosaur` movie available for rent from `Store 1`?""

I defined 'available' as the return date being later than the rental date (unless there's an _'available for rent TRUE or FALSE'_ field that I missed)

Because each VHS/DVD was rented multiple times, I end up with multiple rows per inventory_id. Is there a better way to approach it so each inventory_id shows up just once?

`select distinct(i.inventory_id), i.store_id, f.title, r.rental_date, r.return_date from film f`
`join inventory i on f.film_id = i.film_id`
`join rental r on i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id`
`where title like '%academy dinosaur%' and store_id like 1 and return_date &gt; rental_date`

"file3 = file3.rename(columns={'st':'state'}) (this works for me)"
"I did : file1 = file1.rename(columns={ 'ST':'State','GENDER':'Gender'})"
"Thanks Marian - but not working :thinking_face:"
"Hi!

What does the question ""Understand the meaning of all columns"" mean?"
"And with these questions:

• Which columns are numerical?
• Which columns are categorical?
 I think with some columns we can determine certainly whether it is categorical or numerical.

But some have missing values, or are object, which the way I understand it, means that it is of mixed data types.

How would you determine whether the columns are numerical or categorical in that case?

Should we drop the missing values first and then convert the entries in the object columns into it's correct values?"
thanks
"I think in file3 we have State, so if you would like to rename that to ST to match the other two files, I would use file3 = file3.rename(columns={ ‘State’:‘ST’})"
"or if you wanna match the other two to State, then: - file2 = file2.rename(columns={ ‘ST’:‘state’})"
"file1 = file1.rename(columns={ ‘st’:‘state’})"
"Basically means ""infer from the column names and data types / data appearance what you're dealing with here""... doesn't necessarily require a cell or specific code here to solve the task. More like :brain: work :slightly_smiling_face:"
"and then for the third you leave that because you’ll make the columns lowercase anyways"
"good points! these are exactly the challenges to come across with real world data :slightly_smiling_face:
`customer lifetime value` for example is recognized as categorical - actually I would clean it first, cast it as float and add it to the numericals.

so answer: Double check what your first selection of numericals and categoricals is if you use for example `df.select_dtypes(np.number)`

Regarding dropping: Be careful if you drop rows in the categoricals or numericals dataframe only. Because if you later stitch them together, you end up with dataframes differing in length. What I would do here: Not drop any rows in the splitted numericals and categoricals. But before, immediately after concatenating the three dataframes (let's say your dataframe is then `df_all`) , at least drop the rows that have `NaN` values *only*
You can find those out for example with
```df_all.isna().all(axis=1)```"

"I think it very much depends on the issuing country. While China has the power to make it work, Venezuela clearly doesn't"
"China issued a cryptocurrency (multiple ones, to be fair). The last one has a build in “devalue” function, where the money is worthless if you don’t spend it in x amount of time.
Gouvernments controlling our currency is the reason for so many economic problems, I honestly hope that the new version of money we are going to use get’s rid of these flaws.
Build in inflation mechnanisms and incentives to spend the money quickly and not save it, is definetly not what society needs"
"And also definetly true what you say, but I wouldnt call it cryptourrency anymore, but electronic money.
And we definetly need layer 2 money applications that scale quicker than bitcoin.
I just hope we will get rid of one currency per country/area but adopt one global solution"
"I agree with you that this mechanism may be problematic. But it has been disproven that there is a sound correlation between government printing money and inflation."
"This is why economic orthodoxy moved from  Friedman to the new consensus macroeconomics/DSGE models"
"Reflecting more about it, there is a reason why the Chinese force people to use it in a certain period of time. To be money, a given unit of account like salt, metal or whatever you want must satisfy several requirements. One of this is to be an effetive unit of account, in that its value does not oscillate wildly with time, like in a scenario of hyperinflation. In short, it must effectively guide expectations for the wide public. If the chinese criptocurrency works exactly like bitcoin it wont have this property, at least not for everyone. I guess forcing people to use it before a certain deadline is a form of stabilizing its value. But I agree with you that this does not make sense if the other objective is to make it attractive for the regular investor and thus grant it with liquidity, which is another one of the desirable properties of money. I guess that not only the Chinese, but also the Americans and the Europeans, which probably will experiment with this policy solution, will have to find an adequate mix here.. Its all about policy experimentation. But I'm quiet confident that this government-generated cryptocurrency is the future, because the state is the lender of last resort and the entity ultimately responsible for stabilizing expectations and the business cycle..."

So just to finish what was said in the break out room.

Luke (Skywalker)  has the same name as the director of Star Wars, or is at least derived from it, hence George Lucas.

George Lucas channeled his hero journey into the movies :slightly_smiling_face:"
"burn the heretic"
:smile:
ahahaha
"SW is overrrated!!!!!"
"just kidding, deep down if you look at the star wars series in analytical eyes its all about a family story, how the father was bad, and distant from the family but then the son came up as a good guy and convinced him to become good in the end"

"George Lucas was into Joseph Campbell and Jung I think.  So the way I see it is that each character is symbolic and represents parts of Lucas' psyche."
absolutely
blasphemy!!!!!!!
"but thats what people do in their movies, and why tarantino shows a lot of feet"
"well that escalated quickly"
"It's like Jung wrote the Red Book. Tolkien wrote LOTR."
"is this a good time to mention that though I have never seen star wars, i have been to the set at elstree studios where SW trilogy was filmed and ate in the canteen of the George Lucas Stage next to the big gold robot thing… not sure whats thats called"

"<@U01SJKB2MG8>, i was checking the German constitution and it does not say that decent and affordable housing is a basic right, like it is in Brazil. I guess that this reflects the better material conditions of Germany when its constitution was proclaimed. Perhaps by now this should change. What i wanted to say before was that lawmaking is not an exact science, as it is very much subject to interpretation. If one lobbyst says ""this is inconstutional"" and goes to court another one might say ""yeah, but here it says it is not"". Unfortunately peoples' basic rights tend not to be much considered these days"
"_Das Land habe seine Kompetenzen überschritten,_ says exactly what I said:slightly_smiling_face:, the state of Berlin overstepped its jurisdiction. The court did not rule that the matter of the law itself violates any article of the German basic law, the Grundgesetz - which initself is imho relieving :clap: and gratifying for both our sentiment, that there should be a basic right for housing one day in Germany. Because now there's still legal room for it to make such a law on federal level - which won't happen though if CDU/CSU should also win the next election :face_with_rolling_eyes:"

"My whole trading hypthesis is, that markets are constantly manipulated by the large key investors. You can see their traces in price and volume movements, its quite hard to hide billions of dollars in the chart.
And if you think about it, these players need to engineer the liquidity for their positions.
They often do this by ‘generating’ news that drives price into retail stops or force margin calls with large swings of price.
In unrgegulated markets, this is even worse, and thats why people are under the impression it is dangerous to trade, when in reality you just have to wait for the wave and ride it"

someone (doesn't look like Berlin official) built an aggregator website that gathers all free covid vaccination appointments for the big vaccination centers in berlin.

"I think there's no need in treating Pandas as a new language, since it is just a library living in the Python ecosystem. But I get your sentiment. It takes time to get used to the datatypes (dataframe, series, index, ....) and how to interact with them - address columns, subset a dataframe etc.

on < |Summary Functions and Maps> there’s this part

```map() is the first, and slightly simpler one. For example, suppose that we wanted to remean the scores the wines received to 0. We can do this as follows:```
But what does *remean* refer to? Some kind of scaling of each value as it compares to the mean of the whole column?"

"I quite like the Kaggle explanations. Been reading through a few of them this evening and they do quite a good job of putting things simply.
Two thoughts following this:
1- I think I will treat Pandas as a separate language to learn. It seems like all the functions and use of brackets are distinct from the Python rules. - and maybe on its own it is not so complex to learn (+ I guess one of the most useful for everyday stuff)
2- Within Python, I find List Comprehension (where we put loops in one line)  really tough to get my head around."

"<!channel>,
regarding your *final projects* next week: As we announced, we're going to have *morning stand up sessions* in the morning from Monday until Thursday. These will happen in groups and Kosta, Sian and me will each mentor one stand up group. We distributed you into these groups:
• Sian: <@U01S0MFJ3HR>, <@U01S081EULS>, <@U01S65G72SY>, <@U01S6LCPM0C>, <@U01RNEU3SNA>, <@U01S6L7HLUC>, <@U01RXCQHMHT> 
• Kosta: <@U01RW2X7S9Z>, <@U01SD3CDH9P>, <@U01S1CWGTU4>, <@U01S0E0MRJ7>, <@U01RP2K1606>, <@U01RN7BVD1C>, <@U01RKN0EGDV>, <@U01S133DZ9A>

The mentors will contact you / invite you to dedicated channels to coordinate the further meetings. Keep in mind, these are just groups for the stand up and it doesn't mean you just have to direct your questions to your ""mentor"". Of course you can still make use of the expertise of the whole teaching team and as we mentioned after the previous projects, place your questions first in the <#C0215VDBWPQ|final-project> channel, which ensures that you get help as fast as possible and by the LT/TA who is most knowledgeable (we all have our special fields of interest you might know by now :slightly_smiling_face:)"

 “I suggest the below PROCESS for the CV in the following order:
Follow all suggested steps on your module Careerhack stage 1 to implement best practices for your CV structure draft &amp; LinkedIn profile - pay attention to keywords, metrics, language, etc.
Attend the CV &amp; LinkedIn workshop on Wednesday, 14th April at 6pm to get an idea of what recruiters look at &amp; how
After the workshop in week 4, activate resumeworded* premium and use their BASIC word template to optimise the content based on the tool’s feedback by using the function “Resume Targeting” which requires you to upload a job ad of your choice to get an effective scoring
Reach a score of 70 minimum and copy &amp; paste the optimised content from the resumeworded template to your final CV design
Upload the final CV design and LinkedIn URL to Careerhack on your student portal, so I can approve them via the system
(make sure the sharing option of the CV file is accessible)
Final deadline for stage 1: before the end of week 7 to give me enough time to go through your CVs. If there is anyone who wants to discuss regarding this stage, please make sure to have followed the above steps first and then book the 1:1.”"

I hope you are doing well in your 2nd week :)

It is important to keep up with CareerHack, thus I want to remind you to *finish* *Stage 1* *by* the end of next week (*Sunday, 11th April*), if you are aiming to find a job after the bootcamp. 

We are going to have CV and Linkedin workshops in weeks 4 and 7 that are going to *build on top of your work!*

Two things need to be done by you before or during (depeding on how quick you are with those things) Wednesday's lecture:

1. *Setup a* :spotify: *App and get the credentials*
head to <  and setup an app:
1. click on DASHBOARD on the above panel
2. login in with your credentials
3. click ""create an app"", give it a name and if you want a description, tick the :tick_checkmark:, click ""create""
4. click the huge green box (left picture) for your app that was created. You should see your *Client ID* and if you click SHOW CLIENT SECRET, there's your *client secret* (right picture)*.* Especially don't share the latter with anyone / push it to github. You can revoke it though, if you accidentally did.

We need both the client id and the client secret to connect to the Spotify API and use the Spotipy wrapper.

This means we have just one other short lecture session tomorrow, between the morning class retro and lunch, but I will ask the TAs nicely if one of them will take you through some SQL or Python katas for some collaborative revision in the afternoon, to make up for it."

"Some preparations (can be done before lecture, but shouldn't take long):

• Make sure you can access the *Inspect Element* feature in your webbrowser (every browser nowadays should have this feature, with which you can inspect the html code):
    ◦ :apple_logo: MAC-OS users: It can be, that the feature has to be enabled first in Safari. < |How-To here>. Then you simply press `Command` + `Option` + `I` or do a rightclick on the element of interest and select `Inspect Element`

He does not cook, im afraid, Isabel… but he will prompt my aunt Leri to cook for him now he is vegan…
he loves all and any books, he will treasure whatever you come up with but one suggestion from me would be - take a photo of the whole class doing bear hugs and send it to him with an email and comments from some of you. it wont cost a thing, and he isnt really into packaging and plastic waste as you can imagine"

"morning, folks. What was the Repo-sample for our project?"
"in the solutions section, what is the < |stale.yml> file for /how is it opened/launched :face_with_rolling_eyes:"

"not relevant  for students. Only for the Ironhack education team internally."
"I found it now. Don’t worry about it and other files inside .github . They are usually hidden (with dot in the beginning of the name),  they are important only to the autor of the repository."

"yes you are in the actual lab section Neil! if you remember, we share the solutions with you via Notion - if the solutions were stored right next to the lab that would be quite boring for us all!"
"Software and Hardware setup requirements for this week (unit2):
• Monday - no additional setup needed, you will be primarily working on your project - in python/ pandas/numpy. Ensure you can actively participate in your group by testing your audio/ video on zoom. If this is not possible on your laptop, try the zoom app on your phone or tablet
• Tuesday - zoom - as we have class presentations in the morning, any and all of you should be able to share your screen. Please enable/ test this, plus testing audio functionality / internet speed tests as appropriate eg < |test zoom>, < |test speed> 
• Tuesday lecture and labs - we will be using jupyter notebook with numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries. Nothing new to install but check that your chosen conda environment (if you are using conda) works with matplotlib and seaborn or use your base jupyter environment. 
• Wednesday + Thursday we all will need tableau public (minimum) or tableau desktop (optional) 2021 version. I have given you a lab for tuesday afternoon to complete this setup. I would recommending using the quickstart (same lab) to ensure your laptops can cope with tableau and zoom. Unfortunately tableau is memory hungry and there are minimum tech specs listed < |here> - the alternative on the day will be to work on a browser version, so do let us know if you are struggling with your hardware/RAM so we can prepare for this. 
• Friday- we will return to Python and will be using numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn + < |sci-kit_learn> which will require an install on your chosen python env"

"i cant see on the screenshot what you did before seeing this so can you summarise the steps you took ?"

"just cloning straight from the repo, i used to have it cloned but then that doesnt get updated"
"what is an easy way to open course work in the class git hub into Jupyter? do I need to fork it, must be careful how to phrase that"
"I would clone the repo, then you run a quick `git pull` to get the newest updates in the future"
"however, I would be careful not to push on that repo!"
"ok thxs"
"<@U01RSRE0N3D> 1. Clone the repo. Git pull for newest updates in the future.

2. Work on the local machine
3. Create my own repository and upload the files there

Would that work too?"
Yes!
"you should have the forked repo, where you can `git push` your lab solutions"
"my clone straight from it comes out empty, and if i check the status the snap i shared before shows up"
"i did do a different repo to upload the stuff but i cant just clone the one from sian"
"i knew i was missing a tiny window ! it was buried behind zoom - a message saying do you want to replace the file in that folder lol - the github repo is now updated with my last jup notebook checkpoint < | …]/day3/pandas%20intro%202%20with%20annotation-students-wip.ipynb>"
"so you start with
git clone (repo url)
then after i have added some new content"
"git pull"
"should update the repo remotely saved. you wont be able to push to the repo, but it sounds like you werent using git pull, just re-cloning each time, am I right?"
"yep you need to do some git pulling sir"
"git clone is downloading, git pull is refreshing"
nan
"thinking about it - i would suggest doing a *git fetch* rather than git pull … then in case you save your own work in that repo folder it wont be overwritten - a bit safer"

if you finish the `Lab | Customer Analysis Round 2` you will realize that the date column contains only entries for January and February. So obviously the exercise to filter for Jan/Feb/Mar is a bit dull.

So I overwrote the month number in the csv with random integers. You can give that csv a try, if you want to have it a bit more spiced up :grin:"
"Should we then make a copy of our Jupyter Notebook with Customer Analysis Round 2 and then read marketing_customer_anlysis_x.csv there? :slightly_smiling_face:"
"no, not necessary :grin:
just if you want to play around with another dataset that is a bit more exciting with respect to the tasks.
and don't use my data for the coming Labs please, for consistency"
Oki!
thanks!
"Ok, the dataset will give you an error if you solved the lab properly. Here's why: I subsituted the month part of the values in that `effective_to_date` column randomly with values between 1 and 12. So far so logical. But then also date values with for example ""7/31/11"" got the 7 subsituted for a 2, which would make it February the 31st, which doesn't exist and since pandas datetime is smart, it will throw you an error like this (screenshot). So, better not use my data :grin:, or: *Bonus quest*: Fix my data so that for all Februaries the days are valid :nerd_face:"

Regarding the upcoming Lab `Customer Analysis Round 3` : I inspected it and reworked the instructions. Please take the same data, but take these instructions:

&gt; For this lab, we still keep using the `marketing_customer_analysis.csv` file. You can find the file in the `files_for_lab` folder.
&gt; 
&gt; *Get the data*
&gt; Use the same jupyter file from the last lab, `Customer Analysis Round 3`
&gt; 
&gt; *EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) - Complete the following tasks to explore the data:*
&gt; * Show DataFrame info.
&gt; * Describe DataFrame.
&gt; * Show a plot of the total number of `response`s broken down by response kind.
&gt; * Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by the total claim amount.~ Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind. Try a boxplot and distribution plot, for each `response` kind.

&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by income.~ Create similar plots like in the task before, but for `Income`
&gt; * *NEW*: Create a scatterplot between `total claim amount` and `income`. Play around with the parameters of the scatterplot (markersize? alpha?) and try to identify more features within the data just visually. You can also try different seaborn plots. Check to find suitable ones: < "

"* Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.

is only the response=""yes"" that count as response? or is either response=yes, no a response?"
"It actually means 'number of responses broken down 1st by response kind, 2nd by response channel'"
"So, number of responses on the y axis, response kind on the x-axis, and then the bars for the both responses again split by the sales channel"

`plt.show()`

but I always get errors for the column names:

""Could not interpret input 'Response'"" :thinking_face:  ... did I not install Seaborn properly?"
"the `.boxplot()` doesn't have a parameter called `file1`. you must provide `data` instead, So...
```sns.boxplot(x = 'Response',y = 'total_claim_amount', data=your_dataframe)```"

"<@U01SJKB2MG8> hi Flo, this return AttributeError : module 'seaborn' has no attribute 'displot'"
nan
"Do you have any idea why?"
"Yes, in the newest version of seaborn, they begin to ditch the `distplot` and start aggregating all the distribution plots under `displot()`  (missing the ""t""). `displot` is contained in seaborn version 0.11.1, so in case you get that error, you might want to open another git bash window, activate your current environment and do
```conda update seaborn```"

"its true, for interviews as data analyst or data scientist roles, you will very often be sent a test on your SQL and python skills which looks a lot like this. one of the best skills is figuring out how to work with this software!"

"So what's the point?"
"well i think you are slightly misunderstanding it… with pandas, for example, we might have a few different ways of solving a problem. but the kind of challenge on code wars is more absolute - for example todays challenge, write a function, that can handle the introduction of an integer and then provide a response if its odd or even - one of the tests will be did you write a function"
"and your solution is not a python function"
"but it also said write a script"
"define a function means getting something like :
def test_function(argument1) :
  # Do something with the code, and the argument.
  print(argument1)

# Calling the function."
"""Create a function (or write a script in Shell)"""
"oh i see where you got that from now! makes more sense …"
"I proceeded with the latter"
"if we've made multiple errors on the work do we still upload them? asking for a friend"
"ah got it… but it still isnt a shell function right?"
"Well, I'm new to this. Is what i wrote a script?"
"oh no its not - its a logical argument i believe.
maybe im misunderstanding, but i imagine if you had the full shell script it would have passed the tests.
But as flo said, you can also see what kind of tests are being pushed on your code… like are decimals being introduced, or 0s - whatever kind os stretch test to ensure the code is good."
"this is a bit of info about shell scripting < "
"and this about building functions in python < "
"these might help! but also know we will do much more of this in class through the course"
"soon it will feel more familiar :slightly_smiling_face:"
"and there are still a few ways of doing the same thing - dont worry! if you look at the solutions on code wars you will see things like
```def even_or_odd(number):
    return 'Odd' if number % 2 else 'Even'```
and
```def even_or_odd(number):
  if number % 2 == 0:
    return ""Even""
  else:
    return ""Odd""```
which return the same output but are structured differently!
• one thing to remember is you wont see a lot of print() on code wars as successful solutions - a little tip :wink:"

"you can always update the notebooks in github later, but for now, it means we can have a look at how youre getting on and where those errors are coming up"
"What is the purpose of functions in Data Analytics? To test models, for example?"
"A linear regression?"
"ooh good question…. functions are effectively used to do tasks either repeatedly or robustly (applying rules, arguments, transformations)… you may remember in class that we wrote a clean function to tidy up the gender column, but theres a tonne of ways we could use a function in a data analysis process, from cleaning, through EDA, to predictive modelling. heres a cool example of a function you can use right now
def histograms_numeric_columns(df, numerical_columns):
    ‘’'
    Takes df, numerical columns as list
    Returns a grid of histograms
    ‘’'
    f = pd.melt(df, value_vars=numerical_columns)
    g = sns.FacetGrid(f, col=‘variable’,  col_wrap=4, sharex=False, sharey=False)
    g = g.map(sns.distplot, ‘value’)
    return g
….this is a time saver function…. instead of making a bunch of separate histograms, return all your columns as a grid of histograms. we can look at this in the morning if you like ?"
"a linear regression is a model, rather than a function, and we will start using them next friday :slightly_smiling_face:"
"ok, Sian already answered while I was typing. :grin:

The function serves the purpose to be able to ""atomize"" tasks. (Not only) in data analytics, we're facing the problem to be just overwhelmed by the task in front of us. So the general approach is: break the task into smaller tasks, which then get broken down again into smaller tasks etc.... and for the lowest ones, you would write a function, solve that problem, and then go one level up, reusing that function and solve the problem on the next higher difficulty level (related to _First Principles thinking_ I guess).

In practical terms, when it comes to code, this has the advantange that your code is - as Sian said -
• *scalable* (you don't need to reinvent the wheel at higher levels),
• your code is *reusable* for yourself and others,
• your code is *outsourcable* when you put it in functions*,* out of a notebook for example, to keep your Notebook clear and reduced to only the things you want to show (most of the time, it's the results). You would then import it as we import e.g. pandas right now, `from my_module import my_function` (we can have a workshop on that)
•  it's *robust.* if one function fails to do the job, it may break, but the rest of the code may continue running. You can even implement Error handling in exactly that function to get information in case of an error, why it failed (comes later in the bootcamp, crucial for example in _Webscraping_)
• it's easier to maintain / repair / upgrade. Dependencies are much easier to handle etc.
• Personal feeling: It feels nicer in my head to solve a problem piece by piece
Of course, all of this is merely theoretical at this point but as tasks become more and more complex, you're starting to whish for functions :slightly_smiling_face:"

"I come from an Economics background. There a function is something like ""Y = C + I + (G - T) - (X - M)"", which is the function for GDP"
"You don't authomatize things there"
"So its another mindfrime"
*mindframe
"For me the course until now has been a combination of completely easy stuff with other things that I still fail to grasp"
"well, I would say, functions in a programming world are conceptually not really different compared to your example.... in python it would maybe be something like this:
```def get_gdp(c, i, g, t, x, m):
  y = c + i + (g - t) - (x - m)
  return y```
they also just mimic the concept of functions in math as a relation between two sets (elements of set X are associated with exactly one element of set Y). With the difference in programming being that functions can perform so much more that just project from one set to another"

Hey @sian d, thanks for raising it! I gave them 2 deadlines.

• Sunday, week 7 - Having optimised their linkedin &amp; CV WITH resumeworded to a score of at least 70
[09:19] the reason why i split this is because they only have a 60 premium access to resumeworded, which I want them to activate in the 2nd half of their bootcamp.

So after the deadline week 3, I am doing a workshop in week 4 on wednesday evening to already give them an understanding what recruiters look out for. Weeks 4-7 are more for optimisation because that’s also when the bootcamp starts getting busier.

7. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.
8. Add a rental for movie ""Academy Dinosaur"" by the customer ""Charlotte Hunter"" from employee Mike Hillyer at Store 1. You can use current date for the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table. *Hint*: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there. You can query those pieces of information in other tables. For eg., you would notice that you need `customer_id` information as well. To get that you can use the following query: 
```select customer_id from sakila.customer
where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER';```
Use similar method to get `inventory_id`, `film_id`, and `staff_id`.

9. *(Optional, you can skip this)* Delete non-active users, but first, create a _backup table_ `deleted_users` to store `customer_id`, `email`, and the `date` (use `CURDATE()` , < |link>) for the users that would be deleted. Follow these steps:
    ◦ Check if there are any non-active users
    ◦ Create a table _`backup table`_ as suggested
    ◦ Insert the non active users in the table _`backup table`_
    ◦ Delete the non active users from the table _`customer`_"
"OOF! we covered a lot of ground this morning with SQL. :exploding_head:
…………….I feel the labs this afternoon will give you space and time to try out all of those things we covered today at your own pace. Here are some extra resources I have checked out already, that you might want to bookmark/ walk through;  to embed some of the practices from earlier, and in the case of DDL+ DML - to get some more context for how to use them and practice with, as we ran out of time today :
• < |most common string functions> and how they are used 
• regex in mysql using the keyword < |REGEXP>
• < |dates and formatting of dates eg D%>
• < |tutorial on dates with create, insert + date_add, date_sub, date_diff> 
• < |Nulls v empty> 
• using logic in queries : < |CASE STATEMENTS> and < |IF () function> 
• DML commands : < |UPDATE> and < |INSERT INTO>  
• DDL commands: < |CREATE, ALTER, DROP> (use with caution!) "

Who would be interested in an *optional* workshop in *Object Oriented Programming* in Python?

_Why would I need that?_
• absolutely *no* requirement for a Data Analyst role
• if at all, used in the Data Science field
• to get a deeper understanding of how Python works (what's all the fuss about `class` es in Python?)
• to tip your toes into techniques on how to make code scalable, more easily maintanable - and in the end, solve problems more elegantly
Who is interested, please click the :python:  emoji :catjam:"

"As one of our follow up actions from yesterdays poll :

• for this weeks GNOD project - I have put a very simple minimum viable product together in jupyter notebook which takes a user input (song name) and compares it to the top 100 to provide a song recommendation. This is for the first product image (shown in the notebook) and can be adapted to the names / columns of your own top 100 variables.
• in addition, this could, of course, be extended for the second version of the product (the spotipy songs+ features, kaggle database, unsupervised clustering) , and can be added to by modularising the scraping code, recommender function, spotipy code etc 
i will be available in a breakout room later this afternoon for a q&amp;a on how to use this template."
"<@U01RW140HBP> could I get your opinion? I’m quite behind on everything…

• I also cannot guarantee the Notion class calendar will be available to you for many months after the course

defo!
"it's probably not possible to copy the whole Berlin data classroom into our private notion pages, right?

because usually that option is possible"
"not sure… feel free to explore! i havent found a good way"
"hmm :thinking_face: it looks like i might be able to download the whole calendar as a text file with the links we have added and ALL the documents…as a simple solution i can give you all a copy of that file at the end of the course… but i fear its going to be messy to work with and quite big. - what do you think ?"
"Yes please! :slightly_smiling_face:"
"We can wrangle it :python:"
"example this is what the dashboard lab looks like"
"cool i can do that ! ill make myself a reminder to capture the latest version on graduation week"
"just to warn you though, the whole zip file of today looks like"
"because it contains text files with the links, information about each lecture /lab you wont need to see, and any physical files we shared"
"but yes i am sure you guys can wrangle it!"
"just your average 200 mb file lol"
"ok so we think we have a plan for the notion calendar and notion page (other useful resources) but it will be messy to work with. any links you are very attached to, I suggest to save as bookmarks directly… and i cant help with any links you have shared with eachother via slack - so add that to your to do lists!"
"<@U01S7BM4N81> interestingly i can do the same for slack. never tried. just the public channels. this goes back to before the free slack message limit kicks in, but it spits out a tonne of json files i dont want to play with. maybe i should suggest this to someone for their final bootcamp project !"
"as in we can get a record of every message ever written on our slack workspace, every link shared… but its in json so needs to be wrangled in python"
"Sounds interesting actually, and it should be easy to exctract the links and, lets say, the 2 sentences before that link :slightly_smiling_face:"
"Do analysts and developers create some kind of generic repo where they save scripts and code snippets to not solve problems over and over again? Could be beautiful project as well"
"makes sense - im thinking a bit like a slack api add on repo - slack has an API, but if you use the API and turn that into something reusable, they want to give you a way to share it with others. < 
i suppose finding the right place that already exists would be great for visibility but in general, yes developers do set up repos for problem solving snippets, as well as projects"

<@U01SJKB2MG8> what are data structures then?"

I love the background colour and all the white space you’ve chosen to go for  - i think it makes it look nice and clean. Also you have gone for very minimal labels - its a style i haven’t seen before---im not 100% with you :slightly_smiling_face: , but i like the way you have executed that. Good choice of simple colour scheme, not overwhelming.
• it would be nice if the profit filter controlled the other charts too - so we saw the top customer list and category view change. 
• also it would be nice if the category filter controlled more than one chart
• the lollipop chart needs a little work - looks to me, when furniture is selected, as if the axes arent snyc’d anymore, as the circle  is somehow offset from the bar (not a problem on office supplies), but also the bars and circles could be adjusted to align better. Typically the top of the lollipop is bigger than the width of the bar.
• check your map- in line with my rule of users will do anything you dont want them to, i could zoom out on the map - I normally turn off that zoom or switch to pan mode when publishing a map
• i really like that the map filters the other charts - but you could edit those tooltips to make them look nicer / be more relevant "

a good overall structure, but it doesnt resolve too well on my monitor - have you got it set on automatic size or did you build it on a big screen? maybe test it on your laptop and see how it looks"
"Appreciate the feedbacks Sian, I'm going to work on these :)"

"its a bit visually busy - one way you make it less so is working on removing and labels, particularly axis labels that are unnecessary to the story. sometimes you can get away with a good tooltip and remove the axis altogether.
Good job with the floating legends and filters though, plus i quite like the bottom left bar chart labels."
"i think it would be better if the charts were interactively linked, as at the moment they are just placed… something to work on for the future"
"and it is pretty. I like that you used floating legends and filters to make better use of the space, that you chose a title which is a ‘call to action’ - encouraging people to dive in and explore the data themselves.
I agree with the colours - be careful that people dont assume the same shade of purple means the same thing in two places but nice use of colour background and outlines - if im being fussy the boxes are not quite aligned here"
"but overall good job! this dashboard is not overwhelming :slightly_smiling_face:
Maybe something to work on is the interaction between the charts"
"I agree with Thamo, nice idea to show the lapsed customers in a staggered kind of bar chart :slightly_smiling_face: i would consider the placement of your two colour legends on the right… i feel like you dont need the legend for RFM rc tier as you have the headers in the chart itself. The other legend (the customer segments) you could show the names of the segments in the bar chart and lose that legend too, or float it, in the white space above the big yellow bar.
In general its a good idea to avoid axis which make us have to turn our heads sideways :owl:- theres one axis label doing that now, on your rfm rc tier bar chart.
nice job on the comments - try making that font bold and a bit bigger?
agree with Marian -  put white font on the grey header blocks- i would even add a matching grey outline to the charts to hold it all together
overall - great job!"
"really nice layout Olubunmi! i like the consistent use of colours bar chart to line chart - as a consequence i would avoid using blue again on the map, to save any visual confusion. good size font for the titles, its clear and easy to use.
consider changing the filters from multi select drop down to single button select - this avoids anyone unticking all options and ending up with nothing to look at! We can talk about different options for placing your filters… the truth is they can go anywhere!"
"stepping up with a movie version! nice one :slightly_smiling_face:
i like that youve used a srong, bold font for your titles and considered sizing for an intuitive layout. Its a nice layout too, very logical, and i like the colours.
you seem to have an issue in the filters top right - they are too squashed, so maybe go back and give it more space when you can"
"its great that your region filter affects everything, but the date filter only changes the map, which could be a bit confusing because thats not near the map, its at the top of the dashboard - i would expect it to filter everything.
nice use of a floating legend for the map. when publishing a map its a good idea to turn the zoom functionality off so your end users dont end up really zoomed out"
"not quite the dashboard lab we were working on but ok!
without legends on the scatter plots having the multiple trend lines are hard to interpret - can you think about adding legends , having just one trend line , and instead of lots of small coloured circles which clash with the trend line, you could potentially eliminate all the extra colours or have one grey trend line. Once a scatter plot gets visually busy its worth switching from shape to circles, which can be faded, and show the density better with an outline, so I would have  think about that.
nice use of the bold blue headings - watch out for the _condition of property_ axis, its quite squeezed and the label doesnt fully display on my laptop- in fact you can drop the axis labels i think as each scatter contains the same information on x and y"
"hi thanks for the feedback, I will review my dashboard, I used this data so Id complete my project file"
"yeah I agree with Neil you might want to turn the zoom control off :slightly_smiling_face: we are too used to google maps arent we :slightly_smiling_face:
i like the floating layout, making best use of your space. I would drop the grid lines from the bar charts to keep the whole look clean, or do the same as you did with the lollipop chart - looks like they are really faded out.
Did you consider creating a dashboard title ? it feels sort of lost without it.

the profit legend could go further up the map, nearer to the view title, the category legend is possible unnecessary - something to be careful of - that legend is placed next to california at the moment, which also is blue - suggesting california is furniture, so consider your colour choices.

with so much space going for the  map i think you need to have more information on your tooltip, maybe a viz in tooltip ? but certainly clean the tooltips up a bit!"
"nice, simple three part grid structure - i think it would look neater if you had turned off the grid lines, put a title on the dashboard to bring it all together. I would recommend you to revise and test your dashboard actions … i dont think this is what you wanted to happen"

< #!/vizhome/recyclingandbeer/RecyclingBeer>

I too was messing with that London recycling set… on the < |thread above> there was talk of adding bars on each borough…but…. i cant figure it out. ‘Bars’ gives me HUGE bars on each borough (all the same height and just varying by width….not ideal)… Gantt chart gives me teeny tiny bars of the same(ish) size.

Which formatting option am I not seeing?"
"yes colour and layout are not ideal…started getting too creative with backgrounds…. and the beer prices were in pence, took me a while to get them into pounds with the right symbol :neutral_face:"
"uhhh i LOVE the bier icon!!!"
"but yes the bars look very funny that way, like a raining cloud. Would be interesting to know how to change that scale."
"<@U01RN7BVD1C> i’m having doubts over the data quality….cant remember a London beer ever being that cheap :thinking_face:

unless the figures are taken from a < |Sam Smiths pub>"
"hahaha yeah thats quite cheap, nearly berlin euro prices hmm"
<@U01RW140HBP>
"wow ! quite the bar chart over map combo lol
so what I can see quickly is that although you have Year in your beer data, I cant see any evidence you have london borough, in your beer data - hence the price of beer would be the same for all parts of london - is that what you expected ?  price ranges from 2.26 in 2003/4 to 3.70 in 2019/20, which does feel cheap for london!

as to your visualisation, you are using the size of bars, over the top of the map - but this is duplicated encoding, because you have created a copy of latitude, then changed the display of latitude to bars, even though its just displaying the same information as on the original map.
what are you trying to show on the map ? because if i strip the bars away we just have a map and beer, then it makes sense"
nan
"and well done for getting the beer icon in there and making the beer grow over time… i think if you could get an average price by borough (no idea where from) or a london beer price (i think this must be nationwide) then this would be great stuff!"
"oops…. yes… now I see the beer prices are from the ONS, so will be nationwide:

< | 

per borough would be fun, but a challenge :joy: …having it just for london was the plan

I'm just trying to show some bars on each borough…. shorter ones for lower numbers, taller ones for higher numbers…mainly for the lolz

using latitude twice came from here… but their bars on the US map example look sensible :thinking_face:

Interesting to see here:
• low prices come in all conditions and grades (referring to sub 200k)
• High prices usually have a condition of 3+ AND a grade of 4+
• There’s no high grade-low condition-cluster (I assumed this, and it is true)
• Very high condition and very high grade correlate to higher prices, but are likely not the cause of them"

only negatives i can see - i think theres a sizing problem - the dashboard is published quite long, not too wide, and in line with my rule about testing everything the users can do, at the moment i can zoom out of the map by mistake - i always turn that feature off :slightly_smiling_face: and change the map to pan, rather than zoom"

"for example question 9 on the RFM:

“You should end up with 3 new dimension (blue) columns per customer - test these out in a view with a subset of customer ids”

so 3 per customer on each metric? i.e. they’re in tier 1 but not in tier 2, not in tier 3?"

"i love the comments and insights Karina! and the colour scheme is also very pleasing. I think its a bit of a busy dashboard, particularly because the box plots are a little visually busy - but its really well constructed and the questions are all great

things i would consider changing - i dont think you need the category legend because we can see it in the top left chart - removing that legend would eliminate the whitespace. and do you need the axis labels and scales on the box plots ? i think that could be dropped too"
"also… though i love the colours - you do need to be careful with the same colour being used more than once to mean different things… pink means technology and high sales :rainbow:"

nan
"there are a lot of colours on here- maybe rethink how many colours you want to include in one dashboard - you could use a viz in tooltip or a drill down dashboard instead  - plus, using purple in the header as well as in the rfm segmention ‘lapsed valuable’ could be misinterpreted as purple means x…"
"i like the instructions though and the layout feels quite untuitive, just busy. one way to make it less busy - remove any unnecessary axis labels and titles"
"thank you!!"
welcome!
"fire! theres a fire! good work Francisco. this dashboard is really quite sophisticated in the insights and visually balanced - youve done a good chunk of statistical analysis here and dug into the why, of what makes westminster an outlier. I like the colour scheme (goes well with the fire theme) though i would think about a different colour for the scatter plot- maybe a brown, so it stands out but not too much. also a great use of a polynomial trend line! i hadnt spotted that :slightly_smiling_face:
some tips - i think you could get away without the label ‘borough name’ at least on one of the charts - because its quite intuitive. the chart on the bottom right - i feel like you need a better header that doesnt run out of space.  - maybe something short like ‘popln / borough’
everything else is tidy, but rather than being an interactive dashboard its more of a infographic, because youve answered the questions. It would have been nice to see some interactive pieces with an end user in mind"
"You did a good job. I would remove the stacked columns in the middle (or place them elsewhere,, if they are important) and patternize the colors..."

I want to iterate through a dictionary and retrieve values where they exist. But the key only appears in some of the items. So if I just include it in the for loop it breaks the code (looking for a key that does not exist).

if textlist[0]['reply_count'] is in the item then

Welcome!

random looks very alphabetical haha"

"for the first time ever i'm called top of a list that's arranged alphabetically, my surname starts with S :'("
"There is something I'm still struggling to understand with multiclass classification (or with classification problems in general). The output array, which is actually a quiet large one, is a list of likely predictions. It is used to construct the classification model's metrics. Correct? is there a hierarchy between those values? In the sense that the first value of the array is the more likely one?"
"I feel you Alex, I’m also usually the last :smile:"
"probably more a question for <#C01S58JN5FT|lab-help>. But anyway...
Yeah, mostly correct. Although there's no hierarchy.

The output (let it be `y_predict` ) is an array with values of the different ""classes"" (like the four flower species in the iris dataset). It is of equal length as the feature dataframe (let it be `X_test` ) which you put in the model to predict them. The metrics for classification (< |True negatives, True positives, False negatives, False positives, accuracy score, F1 error, F2 error, accuracy, precision, recall>, ... ) are then calculated (or directly observable in the confusion matrix) by comparing `y_predict` with `y_test` . The latter is the _Truth,_ the first is the _predicted._ One basically looks for every pair of `y_predic` and `y_test` , how many are there of each combination? And then the confusion matrix is nothing but a tally chart of those possible combinations of the two arrays and in a best case scenario you only have matching pairs, which results in the fact that TN's and TP's are maximized.

So, to answer your last question: No, the order of the predicted label array `y_predicted` doesn't contain any hierarchy. It's just what your model has predicted for every corresponding line of your input dataframe"
"Thanks! No, its not for the lab..."
"I'm trying to understand this for the final project"
"That explanation was on point... I needed to understand where the number of output points came from... Thanks again!"
"yey it worked! just takes ages to scrape all top100 songs for all weeks from 2000-2021 :girl-grin:"

"Hi guys, I am trying to iterate though dates without success. My goal is to send one request to this api to get data foe each day in a range of time but I am getting and error. Can you see what I am doing wrong? Thank you:slightly_smiling_face:"
"Hey guys, maybe someone is free now, so I’ll give it a try: I’m trying to concat df’s from which some doesn’t have the same amount of columns as the other one, but most of their columns will match (the values will be different, so I need them to be copied one below each other). I want to fill in the columns which some of them lack with NaN values in the result df. I tried every parameter, none of them returns what I need. :disappointed:

"check this in the documentation, it shows many many ways that you can combine dataframes"
"yeah.. I tried through almost all"
"did you try to ignore the index?"
nan
"i think you are trying an outer join right?"
"if columns are not same in all tables"
"can I show you what I mean in a breakout room maybe? it’s a bit hard to explain in writing :stuck_out_tongue:"
"i think you need to union your dataframes rather than merge = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)
• do this after setting the column names consistently across the frames. 
• get it right for two data frames before trying multiple data frames in one go 
happy to join you if alex cant help, but im sure he can"
"Hey Lilla. Looks like you got a solution - this sounds like a similar issue that was doing my head in all weekend :see_no_evil:.
If you are struggling maybe consider joining the  JSON files first (then to DataFrame afterwards). This is how I did it - but it wasn't pretty"
"Thanks both! Solved it with Alex, it was an outer join with index set to False - what I did already but to test I was checking the .head instead of .shape. Maybe more coffee will do  :sweat_smile:"
"haha coffee and food needed then- well done Lilla and <@U01RW2X7S9Z>"
"Hi, I’m having this error when importing csv to mysql. How should I deal with NaN values?"
"have you tried configuring the columns to allow nulls ?"
"Hi! Why is this happening? I have a range."
"try without the range"
"gives the same error: ‘int’ object is not iterable"
"if you want to iterate over a dataframe i suggest using df.iterrows() instead"
"what do you want to get in the end?"
"for the length of df.fruits_veggies i want to get the results 1 or 2 or 3 saved in body_score"
"ah ok it is wrong…this is probably adding to body score all the time :see_no_evil: but i want  a list"
"```for index, row in df.iterrows():
    if row[index of your fruit_veggies column] &lt; 2:
         do this```"
"and you probably want to append to the list and not sum it up :slightly_smiling_face:"
"you can use directly the column going for fruit in df['fruits_veggies']:
if fruit &lt;2:
and so on"
"like you dont need to user range len df if you iterate directly on the column"
"lol i’ve been iterrowing this whole time, thanks alex!
His solution is most likely quicker"
"i guess iterrows is good and faster if you need to operate on several columns for each operation, i haven't used it yet"
"that works!! Thanks to both of you :pray::blossom:"

"<@U01RW140HBP> is there a way to use max as window function without partition? I was experimenting and trying to filter results where return_date is equal to max return_date. something like:
 select *,
from sakila.RENTAL;
where EXTRACT(MONTH FROM return_date) = max ( EXTRACT(MONTH FROM return_date))"
"i would do this with a self join… hold that thought"
"so the challenge you have here is you cant use the window function as part of the where clause due to the order of execution … they are created in the Select, so cant also be used in Select:
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
this gets you half of the way there… in real life I would normally run the query *select max(return_date) from rental* first, spot that the max month is 9 and then just hard code 9 into my code :
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) = 9* 
…. however to do it programmatically, rather than manually, involves either a subquery or a self join - subquery would be the better way to go.
*select * , month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) =* 
*( select month(max(return_date))  from rental)*
here the subquery is the same as i started with …

a self join method is actually too messy (i tried a few versions) !"
"try using use sakila ;
then your INSERT INTO statement. But i think you will find there are some constraints on the table which require inserting more information than you have here. if you check the create statement for this table you will see we cant have null entries for
*first name* 
*last name* 
*address id* 
*store id* 
*user name.*
what this means is you will get an error if you try to partially fill a record not completing all those cells.
to get all that information, because we know Tammy is already a customer, you can query her records
*SELECT * FROM sakila.customer*
*where first_name = ‘Tammy’*
then you can amend your insert into statement to include that info
*insert into sakila.staff(first_name, last_name,  address_id, store_id, username)*
*values(‘TAMMY’,‘SANDERS’, 79, 2, ‘tammy’)*
if this doesnt make sense lets jump in a breakout room and go through it later!
*actually the user name is made up…. ‘tammy’ which is not obvious* "
"where is often easier ! and you can combine where with a subquery (we will go through this in tomorrows lecture) so that is flexible. However i normally use joins where i want fields from more than one table."
"if your database is clean, all tables have good referential integrity (ie no missing actor_id), it doesnt matter … in general i suggest to start a join with the transactional table but we dont really have transactions in this join between actors and the bridge table, so it could be done either way."

"might be helpful to know how big the bing tiles are - normally the small unit of change captured is 4km square or so …"

"a clarification of what those movement stats mean : The < |Facebook Data for Good program> has released four new datasets pertaining to mobility:
• *< |Movement Range>* comprises two metrics: < |Change in Movement and Stay Put>. The Change in Movement metric is an estimate of the number of the people who are “moving”, i.e., the average number of level 16 < |Bing tiles> (0.6km by 0.6km) that a user was present in during an entire day versus a pre-pandemic baseline. The Stay Put metric estimates the opposite – the number of people who are staying home, i.e., percent of users that were present in only one level 16 Bing tile for at least 3 different hours on a given day."

ok, so in this case you can drag the DS as a filter, choose range of dates, then select week number (keeping it green)
finally change the data type from continuous to discrete (now it goes blue)
this will give you the chance to move between weeks based on their full start date, and will cover both the years

I want to zip 2 lists into a dict. However in my dict I only get 1 value pair. When i zip the 2 lists into a new list, I get all the entries.

{key:value for key,value in zip(owner,id)}"

"so a granular histogram is just counting the unique values… you would only see a count of more than 1 (ie a bar above average length) where the same exact value was replicated across multiple cities. I wonder if thats likely in this data set ?
most of the time in the histograms created in python you are systematically ‘binning’ the data points, as in grouping up the values into buckets, so you should see a bar in your histogram which covers similar values, ie the first bar might account for  all the values between 50 and 58, and the next bar would be all values between 58 and 66 .. try experimenting with the bin size as this might help it make more visual sense to you

• Let’s pretend you work for the company that manufactures and markets a widget
• The company might ask you the following: On the basis of this data, how should we spend our advertising money in the future?
• This general question might lead you to more specific questions:
    a. Is there a relationship between ads and sales?
    b. How strong is that relationship?
    c. Which ad types contribute to sales?
    d. What is the effect of each ad type of sales?
    e. *Given ad spending in a particular market, can sales be predicted?*"
"<@U01S133DZ9A> thought this might be useful for you < 
there is only one variable X in this case, the no of hours studied, but you can better see how the model is evaluated by how closely it predicts y, the % score achieved - where we are fairly sure of a linear relationship (the more i study, the better i do in a test)"

• open your MySQL client and create a new connection, to your local mysql instance - with your uname and password, port 3306
• once the sql dump file is downloaded, do a right click and open with your mysql client 
• run the query - this creates a bank database and populates it with the data

"Is the length of the link the same?
Is it maybe a hyperlink?"
"Split at whitespace is not possible?
Can you post an example? :blush:"
"i understand the confusion !

if you want to hop on a breakout room and talk it through let me know.
One way to think about averages/counts:
if i do a *select count(column) from table* - i will get one value back - think of *select count(student_name) from bootcamp* - the answer is 23.
same rule applies with *select avg(age) from bootcamp* - the answer is probably around 26
if i want to see more than one row i need to do a group by on each column that isn’t the value aggregated
*- select count(student_name), gender from bootcamp* 
*group by gender* 
would return male : 15 , female:8

I always start with joining the tables i need, select all the fields i want to use across the tables, then think about doing the aggregation using count/avg + groupby

However for qu 6 you are right that we can use one table, transactionhistory, because it has transaction ids and the date-- the challenge here is to extract the month and year for our group by."

You have to either overwrite `file3` with the output of that or use the `inplace=True` switch. Otherwise your changes won't be permanent. You just get an output shown, but no changes are made on the dataframe itself. So do something like

```file3 = file3.rename(columns={ 'state':'ST'})```
or
```file3.rename(columns={ 'state':'ST'}, inplace=True)```
I personally prefer the first solution, since not all pandas functions have an `inplace` parameter. And I'm too lazy to memorize which have, and which don't :grin:"

In case of doubt, follow the official Ironhack solutions, because the dataframes you get there at the end, are important for the next Lab. I just didn't see a reason why to drop `education` and `number of complaints`

"Hi, folks. I have questions about Git/GitHub. <@U01SJKB2MG8> <@U01RW140HBP> <@U01RSRE0N3D>

"when modelling, how should we choose the value of `test_size` in sklearn? (`random_state` as I understand is just a random number, or?)"
"random state is the base for a randomly generated number, it is there to ensure consitency if I recall correctly.
regarding test_size, we went with 0.7 for testing and 0.3 for predicting, but our model isn’t the most precise"
"you recall correctly… so if you want to compare iterations <@U01RKN0EGDV> you should always use the same random_state (i generally use 40… theres no reason for it i just chose it early on, 100 is the one you often see)"
"the size of the train test split is kind of up to you. worth experimenting with a larger train set to see what impact it is… but to avoid overfitting to the train i normally choose a 60/40 or 70/30 split"
"so then we should have the same random_state in our iterations, but the test_size we can play with it, right?"
exactly!
"just to ensure the data is splitting randomly according to the same system, we keep the random state number the same, then the results are comparable. changing the split is independent of that, the results remain comparable"
"should there be a predict_size or is that calculated from what you put as test_size?"
"i think is calculated, 1- test_size, so just enter test_size"
"the predict size is related to the test size <@U01S7KCL3DF> --- if i have 1000 rows in my test data set (X_test) with n columns, then y_test will be also 1000 rows (one column) and the predictions will be 1000 rows long, one predicted value for each X_test row."

"“choose the right tool for the job” - would be interesting to see the differences!"
"yeah indeed"
"it comes down to *vectorized* operations (numpy, which does operations always on every element of the array *at once*) vs. some non vectorized ones in pandas. Although pandas builds heavily on numpy, meaning it benefits from that, there are certain ways you can use their API in which you accidentally loose this speed advantage... maybe with that `apply()` you have found one"
"Due to that reason, sometimes you see notebooks in which programmers try to use numpy as long as they can (to generate features for example), and only use pandas if they really have to - especially when it's about calculating with big datasets"

I did it in a very very janky/broke ass way that will crash anytime some kind of audio feature is missing"

"seems so, that would also explain how i could iterate over the 607 playlists provided with only “spotify” as user"
"use the other call that sian mentioned, sp.playlists.tracks()"
"and you dont need the playlist owner name, as the playlist ids are unique"
"and then inside the nested dictionary returned youll find normally a list of items where each one is the track, and then you got to point to the information you want to extract"
"amazng ! well every day is a school day - I couldnt figure out how to use the 607 without the user - i should have just put anything in :slightly_smiling_face:"

"you can safe the standardscaler you used for the first scaling in a variable and then use that variable to call the exact same scaling again :slightly_smiling_face:"
"I mean:  when the user enters a song in my prototype, it should be able to look for the audio features of that song on spotipy, then I need to standardize the values for predicting its cluster with kmeans"

We should compare the audio features of the input song with the ones in the df of the songs audio feautres we got yesterday and recommend another song based on this (with cluster and all from today).
BUT how do I know the audio feature of the input song, if it e.g. not in my df with all the audio features?

hope this makes sense, maybe we can discuss in class after lunch..."
"i guess by function that gets the audio_features for that input track. but question is how to get track_id from track name because i couldnt find anything like that"
"we can use Alex’s giant database lol"
"Perhaps it would be more interesting if the initial input consisted of characteristics of the song, like a degree of danceability of funkiness."
"<@U01SJKB2MG8>, could we do that?"
"you would have to call the spotify api, but as I pointed out in the morning, the algorithm makes it hard to make sure you got the song the user wanted to have"
"<!channel>,
maybe a more clearer description about what the next step is for today. Start at *2.* Point *1.* is just to establish the link to the previous project steps.
1. Determine the audio features of the input song by querying the Spotify API with it. Store that result in a dataframe or numpy array (if the latter, keep track of which element in the array corresponds to which feature). Don't spend too much time on implementing any guessing that should be done by your program (whether user inputs the correct song). To get a working recommender ready, first assume that the user puts in a track name and/or an artist that *exactly matches* how they are stored in the spotify database.
2. take the vastness of songs you have collected together with their audio features and train a k-means model with them - similar how we did in lecture (scaling is important!). Keep in mind, that it doesn't make sense to train a model, when you have *artist* or *title* *name* or *track id* in the data. You need to however have the possibility to later (after your model has determined the cluster ids) reassign the correct *track ids* to the *rows. Y*ou can do this by just adding back the track id to the dataframe that contains the determined *cluster id's,* but of course only if you haven't shuffled your data rowwise. You can optimize a bit the parameters, but for a first iteration of your model, just go with the default values of KMeans and stick with it. Only improve later by tuning the parameters.
3. ""Predicting"" which *cluster id* a song belongs to, would work like this: take the audio-features of the song and put it into a numpy array, let's say `song_array`. The audio feature order must exactly match the order that the model has learned. Call the model with `KMeans.predict(song_array)` to make the prediction. The outcome is only one cluster
4. The recommendation would then work like this: Take the determined cluster id from *2.* and subset your spotipy dataframe to filter for this cluster with e.g. `df[df[""cluster_id'']==2]` and get a random song back from that subset. You can take a look at < |pandas.DataFrame.sample>"
"Hm yeah makes sense to use function to get track id from track name. Guess I have to search for that then as well.

And yes, we could also ask the user input a feature rather then a song ... 

Hm hm hm lots to do here"
"<@U01RRV4JX6Z> woulnt it then just be a lookup? theres no prediction really"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7> the database is still processing"
"i guess your program should call the spotify api  like thamo said and print back all the top suggestions and make the user choose somehow"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7> 11h28min in , 14 more expected"
"hope they dont block your ip haha"
"well i just assumed that they get more calls more often by other apps accessing their API.. hade some timeout errors yesterday but since then its just running!"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7>, the idea would be for the user to deliver some characteristics and the computer to randomly assign the user a song with these characteristics..."
"Predicting a song the user might light according to certain parameters"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> since I ran the data through the standardscaler, can I assume that if i get the data back from spotify i will directly get the right cluster or do I need to scale that data as well?"
"scale it please with the same trained scaler that you used for your training data.
And then its a good idea to take `.fit_transform(X)` apart and do fitting and transforming seperately. So you would do:
```scaler = Standardscaler().fit(X)

X_prep = scaler.transform(X)```
and then later:
```X_song_prep = scaler.transform(X_song)```
"
"why is that? :exploding_head:"
"the splitting part I mean"
"because you want to ""pipe out"" the trained scaler after you fit it and save it. If you do just

`X_prep  = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)`
you don't save it in a variable to be used later"
"that little `scaler` variable contains all the means and standard deviations for all your features and knows how to shift your features"
"The dumb thing is that the spotify df does not have song and artist name. Did i do something wrong?"
"if you only took the IDs, it doesnt have song and artist, i catched it in the step of pulling the song ID"
"the feature extractor does not have song and artist names"
"Via the procedure from monday?"
"in whatever is the step that gives you the song ids, before getting the features"
"but i think that for what we are trying to do, you might not need it?"
"Yeah, that's true, but it seems stupid, though"
"yeah, i guess it's just how they have their internal database set up"
"random question: is there a way to ""save"" a fitted model and import it straight away instead of having to make it learn again in further iterations?"
"yes. pickle it into a pickle < "
thanks!
"And more here:
< "
"pickle it - like preserve it ?"
"can someone help me with this error pls?"
"are the meaning and values of each audio feature somewhere?"
"< "
":smile: eurovision tho haha"
:female-singer:
thanks!!
"i dont know why, but try to change that k,2 to k,30"
"it mitght run but might not be a good result, im still understanding this"
"that doesnt work, dont listen to me! haha"
"maybe <@U01SJKB2MG8> can shine some light on what is being done there more specifically?"
"has anyone managed to get the audio features from a search?"
"you should be able to retrieve the ID of the song you searched, and then use the function to get the features"
"I can’t retrieve the ID"
"what does the search return?"
"a dictionary.
Then I access that dictionary;"
a[‘tracks’][‘items’]
"and that is a list, making it hard to navigate"
"go [0] and see where the id is"
"after tracks and items"
"id might be right there"
"You are an absolute hero, thank you!"
"no worries!"
"i just keep getting higher  silhouette score, the more clusters i add... i mean it doesn’t make sense to have that many clusters, does it?"
"it could! i think it is not very realistic to classify a lot of music tracks in 5 categories! I'm also wondering this so im runnning from 10 to 100 clusters"
"and see if there is a sweet spot in between"
"how many tracks are you working with?"
"Guys, did anybody got the same error while using 'KMeans.predict(song_array)'?"
"my 50k tracks are making me go sloooow"
"my laptop would die haha let me know which amout looks good for u. ill test it too"
"i have 35k"
"Alex, one more question, how did you unpack the features afterwards?"
"```

this is the song array we are using."
"got it, nevermind"
"looks like you didnt train the model, but not sure"
"if i have 51 clusters it splits all my songs in exacrly 699 songs per cluster :smile:"
"tested it and it seems, that piece of code there can't plot `k&gt;5` it seems. still figuring out why"
"ah... I see. It's because the figure is generated as 2 by 2 subplots and the way the plots for the clusters are assigned to the plot areas is determined by this `q, mod = divmod(k, 2)` and `ax=ax[q-1][mod]` expression.
Not really elegant because it only works for 2,3,4,5"
"Sorry to go back to an earlier issue, but: anybody work out how to get the song names ?"
"where are you stuck?"
"Playlist only has IDs - need the song name in our df as well"
"good point!"
"I managed to generate a working code in which, based on a first random recomendation, the computer selects  some more others that a similar to the randomly selected (building on the predictions made). When i replace ""random_song"" with ""filter_song"" in ""getCond = top_100[""cluster""][random_song]"", i get this error.:
```TypeError: Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column```
 Any ideas?"
"i dont get this. i need to add this one song to my whole song dataset and then scale it together? and then take it off again?"
"yeah i took that line off and plotted only the number of clusters i wanted to go for.. no good for comparative analysis but well"
"there is definitely something fishy there"
"yea i think i have some mistake somewhere because all of these 35k songs then correlate on 51 points"
"Once you scaled the data once, you want to save that scaling algo in a variable, so that the exact same scaling happens to new data.

Once you call the spotify api and get the features back, you want to run them through the saved scaler, not the original standardscaler, since using the original one would’nt return a result that is uniform with the scaled dataframe"
"this is because standardscaler takes mean and std and calculates the scaling from there, and that would look a lot different with only one datapoint compared to the whole dataframe"
"`scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)`"
"and next time you have to scale data you just call `scaler`"
"hope that made sense"
"Which datatypes are `top100` and `random_song` and `filter_song`?"
"top 100 is the dataframe"
"what you mean? I based this on Sian's code"
"I don't know Sians code :blush:"
"this here < "
"Any idea?"
"there’s a function here to get the info for a track…maybe you could expand on that?

"you could also select ID, but i wanted to see the name rather then just a number :slightly_smiling_face:"
"exactly you only need to refer to one FROM table, but adding JOIN effectively gives us access to two tables Sam, you can select fields from either and both tables"
"and yes once you joined the tables via the shared key, you can select any field"
"i thought i had to have the 'field in common'/join category or whatever in my SELECT :see_no_evil:"
"do we have a copy of the material where you wrote the difference between PK and FK? :innocent:"
"You could use row_number() instead, to make it prettier:
SELECT f.title, f.length,
row_number() over (order by length desc) as 'rank'
FROM sakila.film f
WHERE f.length &lt;&gt; ' ';"
"But in general it should be right as you did it."
"not quite but close… the partition by length in this case is too unique, so we are ranking each length against itself… if i have a film thats 67 minutes long, another thats 80 mins long, and i rank by the partition length…
67 - ranked position 1 compared to itself
80 - ranked position 1 compared to itself

i am guessing you dont actually need a partition in this case. you can rank the films by length using :
*select title, length, rank() over (order by length DESC) as ‘Rank’*
*from sakila.film f*
*where length &lt;&gt; ' ' or length is not null;*"
"so drop the partition"

"Any ideas where I'm going wrong"
?

"Hi!

What does the question ""Understand the meaning of all columns"" mean?"
"And with these questions:

• Which columns are numerical?
• Which columns are categorical?
 I think with some columns we can determine certainly whether it is categorical or numerical.

But some have missing values, or are object, which the way I understand it, means that it is of mixed data types.

How would you determine whether the columns are numerical or categorical in that case?

Should we drop the missing values first and then convert the entries in the object columns into it's correct values?"
thanks
"I think in file3 we have State, so if you would like to rename that to ST to match the other two files, I would use file3 = file3.rename(columns={ ‘State’:‘ST’})"
"or if you wanna match the other two to State, then: - file2 = file2.rename(columns={ ‘ST’:‘state’})"
"file1 = file1.rename(columns={ ‘st’:‘state’})"
"Basically means ""infer from the column names and data types / data appearance what you're dealing with here""... doesn't necessarily require a cell or specific code here to solve the task. More like :brain: work :slightly_smiling_face:"
"and then for the third you leave that because you’ll make the columns lowercase anyways"
"good points! these are exactly the challenges to come across with real world data :slightly_smiling_face:
`customer lifetime value` for example is recognized as categorical - actually I would clean it first, cast it as float and add it to the numericals.

so answer: Double check what your first selection of numericals and categoricals is if you use for example `df.select_dtypes(np.number)`

Regarding dropping: Be careful if you drop rows in the categoricals or numericals dataframe only. Because if you later stitch them together, you end up with dataframes differing in length. What I would do here: Not drop any rows in the splitted numericals and categoricals. But before, immediately after concatenating the three dataframes (let's say your dataframe is then `df_all`) , at least drop the rows that have `NaN` values *only*
You can find those out for example with
```df_all.isna().all(axis=1)```"

the future is MANGOS (at least according to the ads that target me on facebook)"

"I think it very much depends on the issuing country. While China has the power to make it work, Venezuela clearly doesn't"
"China issued a cryptocurrency (multiple ones, to be fair). The last one has a build in “devalue” function, where the money is worthless if you don’t spend it in x amount of time.
Gouvernments controlling our currency is the reason for so many economic problems, I honestly hope that the new version of money we are going to use get’s rid of these flaws.
Build in inflation mechnanisms and incentives to spend the money quickly and not save it, is definetly not what society needs"
"And also definetly true what you say, but I wouldnt call it cryptourrency anymore, but electronic money.
And we definetly need layer 2 money applications that scale quicker than bitcoin.
I just hope we will get rid of one currency per country/area but adopt one global solution"
"I agree with you that this mechanism may be problematic. But it has been disproven that there is a sound correlation between government printing money and inflation."
"This is why economic orthodoxy moved from  Friedman to the new consensus macroeconomics/DSGE models"
"Reflecting more about it, there is a reason why the Chinese force people to use it in a certain period of time. To be money, a given unit of account like salt, metal or whatever you want must satisfy several requirements. One of this is to be an effetive unit of account, in that its value does not oscillate wildly with time, like in a scenario of hyperinflation. In short, it must effectively guide expectations for the wide public. If the chinese criptocurrency works exactly like bitcoin it wont have this property, at least not for everyone. I guess forcing people to use it before a certain deadline is a form of stabilizing its value. But I agree with you that this does not make sense if the other objective is to make it attractive for the regular investor and thus grant it with liquidity, which is another one of the desirable properties of money. I guess that not only the Chinese, but also the Americans and the Europeans, which probably will experiment with this policy solution, will have to find an adequate mix here.. Its all about policy experimentation. But I'm quiet confident that this government-generated cryptocurrency is the future, because the state is the lender of last resort and the entity ultimately responsible for stabilizing expectations and the business cycle..."

Luke (Skywalker)  has the same name as the director of Star Wars, or is at least derived from it, hence George Lucas.

"SW is overrrated!!!!!"
"just kidding, deep down if you look at the star wars series in analytical eyes its all about a family story, how the father was bad, and distant from the family but then the son came up as a good guy and convinced him to become good in the end"

"George Lucas was into Joseph Campbell and Jung I think.  So the way I see it is that each character is symbolic and represents parts of Lucas' psyche."

I guess that this reflects the better material conditions of Germany when its constitution was proclaimed. Perhaps by now this should change. What i wanted to say before was that lawmaking is not an exact science, as it is very much subject to interpretation. If one lobbyst says ""this is inconstutional"" and goes to court another one might say ""yeah, but here it says it is not"". Unfortunately peoples' basic rights tend not to be much considered these days"

And if you think about it, these players need to engineer the liquidity for their positions.
They often do this by ‘generating’ news that drives price into retail stops or force margin calls with large swings of price.

"<!channel>,
regarding your *final projects* next week: As we announced, we're going to have *morning stand up sessions* in the morning from Monday until Thursday. These will happen in groups and Kosta, Sian and me will each mentor one stand up group. We distributed you into these groups:
• Sian: <@U01S0MFJ3HR>, <@U01S081EULS>, <@U01S65G72SY>, <@U01S6LCPM0C>, <@U01RNEU3SNA>, <@U01S6L7HLUC>, <@U01RXCQHMHT> 
• Kosta: <@U01RW2X7S9Z>, <@U01SD3CDH9P>, <@U01S1CWGTU4>, <@U01S0E0MRJ7>, <@U01RP2K1606>, <@U01RN7BVD1C>, <@U01RKN0EGDV>, <@U01S133DZ9A> 
• Flo: <@U01S7BM4N81>, <@U01RRV4JX6Z>, <@U01S0P26NKD>, <@U01S79YDELR>, <@U01SK96QF5E>, <@U01RV3K524T> / <@U01RVSTNRRT>, <@U01S7KCL3DF> 
The mentors will contact you / invite you to dedicated channels to coordinate the further meetings. Keep in mind, these are just groups for the stand up and it doesn't mean you just have to direct your questions to your ""mentor"". Of course you can still make use of the expertise of the whole teaching team and as we mentioned after the previous projects, place your questions first in the <#C0215VDBWPQ|final-project> channel, which ensures that you get help as fast as possible and by the LT/TA who is most knowledgeable (we all have our special fields of interest you might know by now :slightly_smiling_face:)"

The whole stand up thing, I think is from next week on."

Just had a look at it yesterday and this seems quite a lot :scream::sob:"
"Hi <@U01RN7BVD1C>, yeah i think that's right. Hang sent an email the other day reminding us of the deadline."
"I’m not that sure actually.. This is what’s in the deadline email for 11th April:
 “I suggest the below PROCESS for the CV in the following order:
Follow all suggested steps on your module Careerhack stage 1 to implement best practices for your CV structure draft &amp; LinkedIn profile - pay attention to keywords, metrics, language, etc.
Attend the CV &amp; LinkedIn workshop on Wednesday, 14th April at 6pm to get an idea of what recruiters look at &amp; how
After the workshop in week 4, activate resumeworded* premium and use their BASIC word template to optimise the content based on the tool’s feedback by using the function “Resume Targeting” which requires you to upload a job ad of your choice to get an effective scoring
Reach a score of 70 minimum and copy &amp; paste the optimised content from the resumeworded template to your final CV design
Upload the final CV design and LinkedIn URL to Careerhack on your student portal, so I can approve them via the system
(make sure the sharing option of the CV file is accessible)
Final deadline for stage 1: before the end of week 7 to give me enough time to go through your CVs. If there is anyone who wants to discuss regarding this stage, please make sure to have followed the above steps first and then book the 1:1.”"
"""Hey Francisco,

I hope you are doing well in your 2nd week :)

It is important to keep up with CareerHack, thus I want to remind you to *finish* *Stage 1* *by* the end of next week (*Sunday, 11th April*), if you are aiming to find a job after the bootcamp. 

We are going to have CV and Linkedin workshops in weeks 4 and 7 that are going to *build on top of your work!* 

Btw, I still need 2 volunteers from the Data group for 1 CV and 1 LinkedIn each, so I can review them as case studies during the workshop from a Tech Recruiting point of view."""

• 2:30 meet me back in the main zoom classroom, we will talk about how to evaluate logistic regression models, overfit and class imbalance. 
• 4pm robert will join us 
• the remainder of the day, there are a few optional labs in the Notion to keep you entertained, or you can work on tidying up your regression model to submit it on your student portal. PLEASE everyone submit a logistic regression notebook as your lab (in whatever state) today- either the iris data set or the bank A/B prediction- not just a copy of my or Flo’s notebook though, create your own version with a nice structure (we can tell if you copy+paste !)

Two things need to be done by you before or during (depeding on how quick you are with those things) Wednesday's lecture:

1. *Setup a* :spotify: *App and get the credentials*
head to <  and setup an app:
1. click on DASHBOARD on the above panel
2. login in with your credentials
3. click ""create an app"", give it a name and if you want a description, tick the :tick_checkmark:, click ""create""
4. click the huge green box (left picture) for your app that was created. You should see your *Client ID* and if you click SHOW CLIENT SECRET, there's your *client secret* (right picture)*.* Especially don't share the latter with anyone / push it to github. You can revoke it though, if you accidentally did.

We need both the client id and the client secret to connect to the Spotify API and use the Spotipy wrapper.


*2.* :python:  *Install SpotiPy into your anaconda environment:*
`conda install -c conda-forge spotipy`"

….. this bootcamp is more of a marathon than a sprint. :runner:

I also havent finished my to do list but i am now going to log off, get a beer, have a walk, watch a film … so if youre following my example  pull the :electric_plug:. Good work this week, everyone!!"

"Good morning everyone, a group of us met on spontaneously on Friday afternoon thanks to the Lily Potter group, despite corona rules, oops, judging by the fact we stayed till almost sunset, I think we all enjoyed meeting in person, it would be great if we do it again."
"It was great and we should definitely do it again!:heart_eyes:"
"I missed that, but I want to go next time."
"Yes, it was so pleasant to meet all of you!"
"I think the idea is to give more notice next time and we need to consider corona rules :face_with_rolling_eyes:"
"hey, sorry I hate asking on saturday at this time.... but someone knows what should we do this weekend of Careerhack? because says stage 1, but we already did it, or? is then just the resume worded and check our CV score or another stage?"
"yes, phase 1,"
"and we need to create profile in the portal"
"also run our CV in the resumeworded"
"so stage 1 again and the score? okey thanks karina! now that we talk about it just to tell everyone that the *deadline for that is tomorrow* in case someone forgot heheh :this-is-fine-fire:"

have a great weekend everyone !"
"thanks, Siand. I didn’t forget it this week, I am just fixing my github before doing that. Have a good weekend."
"Thansk <@U01RW140HBP> :heart::heart:"
"UPDATE: (managed to improve my score with a little trick, which was including Ironhack as a work experience). I have a problem with Resumeworded. When i download my CV, it does so in Portuguese, and therefore my score in Resumeworded is lower than it should be because the algorithm doesn't recognize certain categories, such as skills. In my settings the language is english, but this happens regardless.. Did someone have the same issue?"

"I think this is a difficult statistic to get. Probably they dont get reported that often"
"yeah I thought when you go to the doctor and they give you a Krankschreibung they have to report to the insurance company why you are on sick leave with a code and I thought maybe there is a statistic from the insurance companies on that, but I cannot find it :disappointed:"

"How about we organize together a small thank you gift for Robert? :gift::sunflower: We could just order something yogic over amazon."
"The things that Robert said were indeed priceless. About the importance of being kind to others and to ourselfes, etc.... It is an important takeaway for me."
"I am in, however we do it."
"Perhaps Robert already has everything that is somewhat yogic. Perhaps something from a certain country?"

"you mean, that i should fill it again?"
Yes
"happy to fill it again but it will duplicate the responses for them on the other side for sure. let’s wait for <@U01SJKB2MG8>’s answer"

"if anyone has captured great screenshots during the course of other students or funny moments , please share them in this thread"
"aww you guys! i think what robert would really love is anything you feel like you want to send him. he loves getting emails but also hand written letters /cards  (i can give you their address in chilliwack, canada) . He does not cook, im afraid, Isabel… but he will prompt my aunt Leri to cook for him now he is vegan…
he loves all and any books, he will treasure whatever you come up with but one suggestion from me would be - take a photo of the whole class doing bear hugs and send it to him with an email and comments from some of you. it wont cost a thing, and he isnt really into packaging and plastic waste as you can imagine"

"morning, folks. What was the Repo-sample for our project?"
"in the solutions section, what is the < |stale.yml> file for /how is it opened/launched :face_with_rolling_eyes:"
"I did not find it. But yml is an extension for the python environment. It shows the requeriment (libraries and their versions) we need to run the project."
"not relevant  for students. Only for the Ironhack education team internally."
"I found it now. Don’t worry about it and other files inside .github . They are usually hidden (with dot in the beginning of the name),  they are important only to the autor of the repository."
"btw... that's also not the solutions section:slightly_smiling_face:"
"yes you are in the actual lab section Neil! if you remember, we share the solutions with you via Notion - if the solutions were stored right next to the lab that would be quite boring for us all!"
"Software and Hardware setup requirements for this week (unit2):
• Monday - no additional setup needed, you will be primarily working on your project - in python/ pandas/numpy. Ensure you can actively participate in your group by testing your audio/ video on zoom. If this is not possible on your laptop, try the zoom app on your phone or tablet
• Tuesday - zoom - as we have class presentations in the morning, any and all of you should be able to share your screen. Please enable/ test this, plus testing audio functionality / internet speed tests as appropriate eg < |test zoom>, < |test speed> 
• Tuesday lecture and labs - we will be using jupyter notebook with numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries. Nothing new to install but check that your chosen conda environment (if you are using conda) works with matplotlib and seaborn or use your base jupyter environment. 
• Wednesday + Thursday we all will need tableau public (minimum) or tableau desktop (optional) 2021 version. I have given you a lab for tuesday afternoon to complete this setup. I would recommending using the quickstart (same lab) to ensure your laptops can cope with tableau and zoom. Unfortunately tableau is memory hungry and there are minimum tech specs listed < |here> - the alternative on the day will be to work on a browser version, so do let us know if you are struggling with your hardware/RAM so we can prepare for this. 
• Friday- we will return to Python and will be using numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn + < |sci-kit_learn> which will require an install on your chosen python env"

"when cloning the class repo to keep getting the files that Sian uploads, the file shows empty and this shows up in git status, but i never deleted the files. Happens every time i clone it"
"if there is a easy turnaround please help me out :sweat_smile:"
"are you doing git pull or git clone ?"
"i cant see on the screenshot what you did before seeing this so can you summarise the steps you took ?"
"git clone"
"just cloning straight from the repo, i used to have it cloned but then that doesnt get updated"
"what is an easy way to open course work in the class git hub into Jupyter? do I need to fork it, must be careful how to phrase that"
"I would clone the repo, then you run a quick `git pull` to get the newest updates in the future"
"however, I would be careful not to push on that repo!"
"ok thxs"
"<@U01RSRE0N3D> 1. Clone the repo. Git pull for newest updates in the future.

2. Work on the local machine
3. Create my own repository and upload the files there

Would that work too?"
Yes!
"you should have the forked repo, where you can `git push` your lab solutions"
"my clone straight from it comes out empty, and if i check the status the snap i shared before shows up"
"i did do a different repo to upload the stuff but i cant just clone the one from sian"
"i knew i was missing a tiny window ! it was buried behind zoom - a message saying do you want to replace the file in that folder lol - the github repo is now updated with my last jup notebook checkpoint < | …]/day3/pandas%20intro%202%20with%20annotation-students-wip.ipynb>"
"so you start with
git clone (repo url)
then after i have added some new content"
"git pull"
"should update the repo remotely saved. you wont be able to push to the repo, but it sounds like you werent using git pull, just re-cloning each time, am I right?"
"yep you need to do some git pulling sir"
"git clone is downloading, git pull is refreshing"
nan
"thinking about it - i would suggest doing a *git fetch* rather than git pull … then in case you save your own work in that repo folder it wont be overwritten - a bit safer"
"<!channel>,
if you finish the `Lab | Customer Analysis Round 2` you will realize that the date column contains only entries for January and February. So obviously the exercise to filter for Jan/Feb/Mar is a bit dull.

So I overwrote the month number in the csv with random integers. You can give that csv a try, if you want to have it a bit more spiced up :grin:"
"Should we then make a copy of our Jupyter Notebook with Customer Analysis Round 2 and then read marketing_customer_anlysis_x.csv there? :slightly_smiling_face:"
"no, not necessary :grin:
just if you want to play around with another dataset that is a bit more exciting with respect to the tasks.
and don't use my data for the coming Labs please, for consistency"
Oki!
thanks!
"Ok, the dataset will give you an error if you solved the lab properly. Here's why: I subsituted the month part of the values in that `effective_to_date` column randomly with values between 1 and 12. So far so logical. But then also date values with for example ""7/31/11"" got the 7 subsituted for a 2, which would make it February the 31st, which doesn't exist and since pandas datetime is smart, it will throw you an error like this (screenshot). So, better not use my data :grin:, or: *Bonus quest*: Fix my data so that for all Februaries the days are valid :nerd_face:"

Regarding the upcoming Lab `Customer Analysis Round 3` : I inspected it and reworked the instructions. Please take the same data, but take these instructions:

&gt; For this lab, we still keep using the `marketing_customer_analysis.csv` file. You can find the file in the `files_for_lab` folder.
&gt; 
&gt; *Get the data*
&gt; Use the same jupyter file from the last lab, `Customer Analysis Round 3`
&gt; 
&gt; *EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) - Complete the following tasks to explore the data:*
&gt; * Show DataFrame info.
&gt; * Describe DataFrame.
&gt; * Show a plot of the total number of `response`s broken down by response kind.
&gt; * Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by the total claim amount.~ Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind. Try a boxplot and distribution plot, for each `response` kind. For the distribution plot, try to plot both kinds of responses in one chart (you can try with seaborn's histplot, using the `hue` parameter).
&gt; * ~Show a plot of the response rate by income.~ Create similar plots like in the task before, but for `Income`
&gt; * *NEW*: Create a scatterplot between `total claim amount` and `income`. Play around with the parameters of the scatterplot (markersize? alpha?) and try to identify more features within the data just visually. You can also try different seaborn plots. Check to find suitable ones: < "
"Hey, so Im still not getting how to get my data from Git hub into Jupyter, clone then pull..anybody else still having problems with this? maybe a TA could walk me through it"
"I am on it"
"let me know if someone else needs help"
"* Show a plot of the ~response rate~ number of `response`s by the `sales channel`.

is only the response=""yes"" that count as response? or is either response=yes, no a response?"
"It actually means 'number of responses broken down 1st by response kind, 2nd by response channel'"
"So, number of responses on the y axis, response kind on the x-axis, and then the bars for the both responses again split by the sales channel"
understood!
"me too... but watching the GitHub link that Tony shared is on my to do list:

< "
"Thanks, Kosta walked me through it, but Ill watch this too"
"The Video from <@U01RXCQHMHT> was very helpful :clap:"
"for this:

&gt; Show a plot of the distribution of the `total claim amount`, broken down by `response` kind.
trying to use
`sns.boxplot(x = 'Response',y = 'total_claim_amount', file1=file1)`
`plt.show()`

but I always get errors for the column names:

""Could not interpret input 'Response'"" :thinking_face:  ... did I not install Seaborn properly?"
"the `.boxplot()` doesn't have a parameter called `file1`. you must provide `data` instead, So...
```sns.boxplot(x = 'Response',y = 'total_claim_amount', data=your_dataframe)```"
"still the same when I add the name of my dataframe :confused:"
"sns.histplot(data=file, x=""Total Claim Amount"", hue=""Response"", multiple=""stack"")"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> hi Flo, this return AttributeError : module 'seaborn' has no attribute 'displot'"
nan
"Do you have any idea why?"
"Yes, in the newest version of seaborn, they begin to ditch the `distplot` and start aggregating all the distribution plots under `displot()`  (missing the ""t""). `displot` is contained in seaborn version 0.11.1, so in case you get that error, you might want to open another git bash window, activate your current environment and do
```conda update seaborn```"

"It works on Python Shell"
"i think they want you to create and use a function"
"But the instruction also says or create a shell"
"*write a script"
"I dont get what'S the purpose of this exercise. During the lectures you said that Pandas/python has always ten or more ways to do some particular operation."
"we will have challenges in this way when we apply to a job"
"before the first interview"
?
"A reminder <!channel> for all to upload your lab work from this week to the student portal before the end of tomorrow please. at the moment 12 students have not submitted any lab work. for any students who arent sure how to do that, please add a :rabbit: emoji below"
"its true, for interviews as data analyst or data scientist roles, you will very often be sent a test on your SQL and python skills which looks a lot like this. one of the best skills is figuring out how to work with this software!"
"So it is not true that there are ten ways to do something, as there is one that is the desired one"
"num = int(input(""Enter a number: ""))
if (num % 2) == 0:
   print(""Even"".format(num))
else:
   print(""Odd"".format(num))"
"I put this on Python, and it worked"
"So what's the point?"
"well i think you are slightly misunderstanding it… with pandas, for example, we might have a few different ways of solving a problem. but the kind of challenge on code wars is more absolute - for example todays challenge, write a function, that can handle the introduction of an integer and then provide a response if its odd or even - one of the tests will be did you write a function"
"and your solution is not a python function"
"but it also said write a script"
"define a function means getting something like :
def test_function(argument1) :
  # Do something with the code, and the argument.
  print(argument1)

# Calling the function."
"""Create a function (or write a script in Shell)"""
"oh i see where you got that from now! makes more sense …"
"I proceeded with the latter"
"if we've made multiple errors on the work do we still upload them? asking for a friend"
"ah got it… but it still isnt a shell function right?"
"Well, I'm new to this. Is what i wrote a script?"
"oh no its not - its a logical argument i believe.
maybe im misunderstanding, but i imagine if you had the full shell script it would have passed the tests.
But as flo said, you can also see what kind of tests are being pushed on your code… like are decimals being introduced, or 0s - whatever kind os stretch test to ensure the code is good."
"this is a bit of info about shell scripting < "
"and this about building functions in python < "
"these might help! but also know we will do much more of this in class through the course"
"soon it will feel more familiar :slightly_smiling_face:"
"and there are still a few ways of doing the same thing - dont worry! if you look at the solutions on code wars you will see things like
```def even_or_odd(number):
    return 'Odd' if number % 2 else 'Even'```
and
```def even_or_odd(number):
  if number % 2 == 0:
    return ""Even""
  else:
    return ""Odd""```
which return the same output but are structured differently!
• one thing to remember is you wont see a lot of print() on code wars as successful solutions - a little tip :wink:"
"yes i think thats the best approach actually"
"you can always update the notebooks in github later, but for now, it means we can have a look at how youre getting on and where those errors are coming up"
"What is the purpose of functions in Data Analytics? To test models, for example?"
"A linear regression?"
"ooh good question…. functions are effectively used to do tasks either repeatedly or robustly (applying rules, arguments, transformations)… you may remember in class that we wrote a clean function to tidy up the gender column, but theres a tonne of ways we could use a function in a data analysis process, from cleaning, through EDA, to predictive modelling. heres a cool example of a function you can use right now
def histograms_numeric_columns(df, numerical_columns):
    ‘’'
    Takes df, numerical columns as list
    Returns a grid of histograms
    ‘’'
    f = pd.melt(df, value_vars=numerical_columns)
    g = sns.FacetGrid(f, col=‘variable’,  col_wrap=4, sharex=False, sharey=False)
    g = g.map(sns.distplot, ‘value’)
    return g
….this is a time saver function…. instead of making a bunch of separate histograms, return all your columns as a grid of histograms. we can look at this in the morning if you like ?"
"a linear regression is a model, rather than a function, and we will start using them next friday :slightly_smiling_face:"
"ok, Sian already answered while I was typing. :grin:

The function serves the purpose to be able to ""atomize"" tasks. (Not only) in data analytics, we're facing the problem to be just overwhelmed by the task in front of us. So the general approach is: break the task into smaller tasks, which then get broken down again into smaller tasks etc.... and for the lowest ones, you would write a function, solve that problem, and then go one level up, reusing that function and solve the problem on the next higher difficulty level (related to _First Principles thinking_ I guess).

In practical terms, when it comes to code, this has the advantange that your code is - as Sian said -
• *scalable* (you don't need to reinvent the wheel at higher levels),
• your code is *reusable* for yourself and others,
• your code is *outsourcable* when you put it in functions*,* out of a notebook for example, to keep your Notebook clear and reduced to only the things you want to show (most of the time, it's the results). You would then import it as we import e.g. pandas right now, `from my_module import my_function` (we can have a workshop on that)
•  it's *robust.* if one function fails to do the job, it may break, but the rest of the code may continue running. You can even implement Error handling in exactly that function to get information in case of an error, why it failed (comes later in the bootcamp, crucial for example in _Webscraping_)
• it's easier to maintain / repair / upgrade. Dependencies are much easier to handle etc.
• Personal feeling: It feels nicer in my head to solve a problem piece by piece
Of course, all of this is merely theoretical at this point but as tasks become more and more complex, you're starting to whish for functions :slightly_smiling_face:"

"What's more overwhelming at this time of the course is to know that this things arent yet authomatic. You tell us something, and we modify it it. But ""getting creative"" at this point is yet another thing. I guess we'll come there at a later point of the course"
"I come from an Economics background. There a function is something like ""Y = C + I + (G - T) - (X - M)"", which is the function for GDP"
"You don't authomatize things there"
"So its another mindfrime"
*mindframe
"For me the course until now has been a combination of completely easy stuff with other things that I still fail to grasp"
"well, I would say, functions in a programming world are conceptually not really different compared to your example.... in python it would maybe be something like this:
```def get_gdp(c, i, g, t, x, m):
  y = c + i + (g - t) - (x - m)
  return y```
they also just mimic the concept of functions in math as a relation between two sets (elements of set X are associated with exactly one element of set Y). With the difference in programming being that functions can perform so much more that just project from one set to another"

Hey @sian d, thanks for raising it! I gave them 2 deadlines.

• Sunday, week 3 - Having applied all suggestions from Careerhack  stage 1 on their linkedin &amp; CV (without activating the optimisation tool, resumeworded)
• Sunday, week 7 - Having optimised their linkedin &amp; CV WITH resumeworded to a score of at least 70
[09:19] the reason why i split this is because they only have a 60 premium access to resumeworded, which I want them to activate in the 2nd half of their bootcamp.

So after the deadline week 3, I am doing a workshop in week 4 on wednesday evening to already give them an understanding what recruiters look out for. Weeks 4-7 are more for optimisation because that’s also when the bootcamp starts getting busier.
[09:21] let me know if this is clear, I do understand that this staged process can be a bit confusing - will make it clearer for the next bootcamp."

 :microscope: *regarding the today's labs (after lecture/lunch)*
please stick to these ""improved"" instructions (and not the ones you find under the github link):

• *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.5*
1. Select all the actors with the first name ‘Scarlett’.
2. How many films (movies) are available for rent and how many films have been rented?
3. What are the shortest and longest movie duration? Return the results as columns with the names  `max_duration` and `min_duration`.
4. What's the average movie duration expressed in format (hours, minutes) Return the result as columns with the names `hours` and `minutes`?
5. How many distinct (different) actors' last names are there?
6. Since how many days has the company been operating (check the `DATEDIFF()` function)? Hint: rental table
7. Show all rental information with additional columns `month` and `weekday`. (hint: `DATE_FORMAT()` ). Get 20 results.
8. Add an additional column `day_type` with values _'weekend'_ and _'workday'_ depending on the rental day of the week.
9. How many rentals were made in the last month of renting activity?
.... stay tuned, improved instructions for the other labs will maybe follow"
"<!channel>,
:microscope: for *Lab | SQL Queries - Lesson 2.6*
please use these instructions

1. Get the unique release years.
2. Get all films with _ARMAGEDDON_ in the title.
3. Get all films which title ends with _APOLLO_.
4. Get 10 the longest films.
5. How many films include *Behind the Scenes* content?
6. Drop column `picture` from `staff`.
7. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.
8. Add a rental for movie ""Academy Dinosaur"" by the customer ""Charlotte Hunter"" from employee Mike Hillyer at Store 1. You can use current date for the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table. *Hint*: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there. You can query those pieces of information in other tables. For eg., you would notice that you need `customer_id` information as well. To get that you can use the following query: 
```select customer_id from sakila.customer
where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER';```
Use similar method to get `inventory_id`, `film_id`, and `staff_id`.

9. *(Optional, you can skip this)* Delete non-active users, but first, create a _backup table_ `deleted_users` to store `customer_id`, `email`, and the `date` (use `CURDATE()` , < |link>) for the users that would be deleted. Follow these steps:
    ◦ Check if there are any non-active users
    ◦ Create a table _`backup table`_ as suggested
    ◦ Insert the non active users in the table _`backup table`_
    ◦ Delete the non active users from the table _`customer`_"

Who would be interested in an *optional* workshop in *Object Oriented Programming* in Python?

_Why would I need that?_
• absolutely *no* requirement for a Data Analyst role
• if at all, used in the Data Science field
• to get a deeper understanding of how Python works (what's all the fuss about `class` es in Python?)
• to tip your toes into techniques on how to make code scalable, more easily maintanable - and in the end, solve problems more elegantly
Who is interested, please click the :python:  emoji :catjam:"

"feedback on the labs i looked at last night - the best examples I saw were Sam, Marian, Phine, Jerrit, Alex, Antonio, Isabel - well done all of you. If you ask them, perhaps they will share their notebooks with you :slightly_smiling_face:
• jerrit and Phine both made framed summary tables which was a nice tip
• isabel did some cool things with coloured bars next to eachother (much better than my suggested horizontal bars!)
• marian and antonio had very neat notebooks (though in marians case it wasnt named - just untitled!)
• sam and alex extended their evaluation of the data into other charts and questions "

"As one of our follow up actions from yesterdays poll :

• for this weeks GNOD project - I have put a very simple minimum viable product together in jupyter notebook which takes a user input (song name) and compares it to the top 100 to provide a song recommendation. This is for the first product image (shown in the notebook) and can be adapted to the names / columns of your own top 100 variables.
• in addition, this could, of course, be extended for the second version of the product (the spotipy songs+ features, kaggle database, unsupervised clustering) , and can be added to by modularising the scraping code, recommender function, spotipy code etc 
i will be available in a breakout room later this afternoon for a q&amp;a on how to use this template."
"<@U01RW140HBP> could I get your opinion? I’m quite behind on everything…

I was thinking of going back over previous days/notebooks, get something atleast functional… then coming back to the unsupervised ML lectures later (maybe tonight)? Would that be an idea?"

"If you find yourself with some downtime this afternoon <!channel>, this is probably a good week to start saving a list of your useful bookmarks from this course.
• Anything you wish to keep from the Notion calendar 
• Also the < |additional resources page> - 
• as you may have noticed slack is truncated after a certain number of messages so we move all the useful links to Notion for you we see on the public channels, but this doesnt cover private channels. 
• I also cannot guarantee the Notion class calendar will be available to you for many months after the course 
(these things are not in our control!)"
"( i find bad news when delivered by a cute dog is better received - is it true? )"
"Is there an easy way to copy those notion pages as pdf’s or on our on notion?"
defo!
"it's probably not possible to copy the whole Berlin data classroom into our private notion pages, right?

because usually that option is possible"
"not sure… feel free to explore! i havent found a good way"
"hmm :thinking_face: it looks like i might be able to download the whole calendar as a text file with the links we have added and ALL the documents…as a simple solution i can give you all a copy of that file at the end of the course… but i fear its going to be messy to work with and quite big. - what do you think ?"
"Yes please! :slightly_smiling_face:"
"We can wrangle it :python:"
"example this is what the dashboard lab looks like"
"cool i can do that ! ill make myself a reminder to capture the latest version on graduation week"
"just to warn you though, the whole zip file of today looks like"
"because it contains text files with the links, information about each lecture /lab you wont need to see, and any physical files we shared"
"but yes i am sure you guys can wrangle it!"
"just your average 200 mb file lol"
"ok so we think we have a plan for the notion calendar and notion page (other useful resources) but it will be messy to work with. any links you are very attached to, I suggest to save as bookmarks directly… and i cant help with any links you have shared with eachother via slack - so add that to your to do lists!"
"<@U01S7BM4N81> interestingly i can do the same for slack. never tried. just the public channels. this goes back to before the free slack message limit kicks in, but it spits out a tonne of json files i dont want to play with. maybe i should suggest this to someone for their final bootcamp project !"
"as in we can get a record of every message ever written on our slack workspace, every link shared… but its in json so needs to be wrangled in python"
"Sounds interesting actually, and it should be easy to exctract the links and, lets say, the 2 sentences before that link :slightly_smiling_face:"
"Do analysts and developers create some kind of generic repo where they save scripts and code snippets to not solve problems over and over again? Could be beautiful project as well"
"makes sense - im thinking a bit like a slack api add on repo - slack has an API, but if you use the API and turn that into something reusable, they want to give you a way to share it with others. < 
i suppose finding the right place that already exists would be great for visibility but in general, yes developers do set up repos for problem solving snippets, as well as projects"

I love the background colour and all the white space you’ve chosen to go for  - i think it makes it look nice and clean. Also you have gone for very minimal labels - its a style i haven’t seen before---im not 100% with you :slightly_smiling_face: , but i like the way you have executed that. Good choice of simple colour scheme, not overwhelming.
• it would be nice if the profit filter controlled the other charts too - so we saw the top customer list and category view change. 
• also it would be nice if the category filter controlled more than one chart
• the lollipop chart needs a little work - looks to me, when furniture is selected, as if the axes arent snyc’d anymore, as the circle  is somehow offset from the bar (not a problem on office supplies), but also the bars and circles could be adjusted to align better. Typically the top of the lollipop is bigger than the width of the bar.
• check your map- in line with my rule of users will do anything you dont want them to, i could zoom out on the map - I normally turn off that zoom or switch to pan mode when publishing a map
• i really like that the map filters the other charts - but you could edit those tooltips to make them look nicer / be more relevant "

"its a bit visually busy - one way you make it less so is working on removing and labels, particularly axis labels that are unnecessary to the story. sometimes you can get away with a good tooltip and remove the axis altogether.
Good job with the floating legends and filters though, plus i quite like the bottom left bar chart labels."
"i think it would be better if the charts were interactively linked, as at the moment they are just placed… something to work on for the future"
"and it is pretty. I like that you used floating legends and filters to make better use of the space, that you chose a title which is a ‘call to action’ - encouraging people to dive in and explore the data themselves.
I agree with the colours - be careful that people dont assume the same shade of purple means the same thing in two places but nice use of colour background and outlines - if im being fussy the boxes are not quite aligned here"
"but overall good job! this dashboard is not overwhelming :slightly_smiling_face:
Maybe something to work on is the interaction between the charts"
"I agree with Thamo, nice idea to show the lapsed customers in a staggered kind of bar chart :slightly_smiling_face: i would consider the placement of your two colour legends on the right… i feel like you dont need the legend for RFM rc tier as you have the headers in the chart itself. The other legend (the customer segments) you could show the names of the segments in the bar chart and lose that legend too, or float it, in the white space above the big yellow bar.
In general its a good idea to avoid axis which make us have to turn our heads sideways :owl:- theres one axis label doing that now, on your rfm rc tier bar chart.
nice job on the comments - try making that font bold and a bit bigger?
agree with Marian -  put white font on the grey header blocks- i would even add a matching grey outline to the charts to hold it all together
overall - great job!"
"really nice layout Olubunmi! i like the consistent use of colours bar chart to line chart - as a consequence i would avoid using blue again on the map, to save any visual confusion. good size font for the titles, its clear and easy to use.
consider changing the filters from multi select drop down to single button select - this avoids anyone unticking all options and ending up with nothing to look at! We can talk about different options for placing your filters… the truth is they can go anywhere!"
"stepping up with a movie version! nice one :slightly_smiling_face:
i like that youve used a srong, bold font for your titles and considered sizing for an intuitive layout. Its a nice layout too, very logical, and i like the colours.
you seem to have an issue in the filters top right - they are too squashed, so maybe go back and give it more space when you can"
"its great that your region filter affects everything, but the date filter only changes the map, which could be a bit confusing because thats not near the map, its at the top of the dashboard - i would expect it to filter everything.
nice use of a floating legend for the map. when publishing a map its a good idea to turn the zoom functionality off so your end users dont end up really zoomed out"
"not quite the dashboard lab we were working on but ok!
without legends on the scatter plots having the multiple trend lines are hard to interpret - can you think about adding legends , having just one trend line , and instead of lots of small coloured circles which clash with the trend line, you could potentially eliminate all the extra colours or have one grey trend line. Once a scatter plot gets visually busy its worth switching from shape to circles, which can be faded, and show the density better with an outline, so I would have  think about that.
nice use of the bold blue headings - watch out for the _condition of property_ axis, its quite squeezed and the label doesnt fully display on my laptop- in fact you can drop the axis labels i think as each scatter contains the same information on x and y"
"hi thanks for the feedback, I will review my dashboard, I used this data so Id complete my project file"
"yeah I agree with Neil you might want to turn the zoom control off :slightly_smiling_face: we are too used to google maps arent we :slightly_smiling_face:
i like the floating layout, making best use of your space. I would drop the grid lines from the bar charts to keep the whole look clean, or do the same as you did with the lollipop chart - looks like they are really faded out.
Did you consider creating a dashboard title ? it feels sort of lost without it.

the profit legend could go further up the map, nearer to the view title, the category legend is possible unnecessary - something to be careful of - that legend is placed next to california at the moment, which also is blue - suggesting california is furniture, so consider your colour choices.

with so much space going for the  map i think you need to have more information on your tooltip, maybe a viz in tooltip ? but certainly clean the tooltips up a bit!"
"nice, simple three part grid structure - i think it would look neater if you had turned off the grid lines, put a title on the dashboard to bring it all together. I would recommend you to revise and test your dashboard actions … i dont think this is what you wanted to happen"

< #!/vizhome/recyclingandbeer/RecyclingBeer>

I too was messing with that London recycling set… on the < |thread above> there was talk of adding bars on each borough…but…. i cant figure it out. ‘Bars’ gives me HUGE bars on each borough (all the same height and just varying by width….not ideal)… Gantt chart gives me teeny tiny bars of the same(ish) size.

Which formatting option am I not seeing?"
"yes colour and layout are not ideal…started getting too creative with backgrounds…. and the beer prices were in pence, took me a while to get them into pounds with the right symbol :neutral_face:"
"uhhh i LOVE the bier icon!!!"
"but yes the bars look very funny that way, like a raining cloud. Would be interesting to know how to change that scale."
"<@U01RN7BVD1C> i’m having doubts over the data quality….cant remember a London beer ever being that cheap :thinking_face:

unless the figures are taken from a < |Sam Smiths pub>"
"hahaha yeah thats quite cheap, nearly berlin euro prices hmm"
<@U01RW140HBP>
"wow ! quite the bar chart over map combo lol
so what I can see quickly is that although you have Year in your beer data, I cant see any evidence you have london borough, in your beer data - hence the price of beer would be the same for all parts of london - is that what you expected ?  price ranges from 2.26 in 2003/4 to 3.70 in 2019/20, which does feel cheap for london!

as to your visualisation, you are using the size of bars, over the top of the map - but this is duplicated encoding, because you have created a copy of latitude, then changed the display of latitude to bars, even though its just displaying the same information as on the original map.
what are you trying to show on the map ? because if i strip the bars away we just have a map and beer, then it makes sense"
nan
"and well done for getting the beer icon in there and making the beer grow over time… i think if you could get an average price by borough (no idea where from) or a london beer price (i think this must be nationwide) then this would be great stuff!"
"oops…. yes… now I see the beer prices are from the ONS, so will be nationwide:

< | 

per borough would be fun, but a challenge :joy: …having it just for london was the plan

I'm just trying to show some bars on each borough…. shorter ones for lower numbers, taller ones for higher numbers…mainly for the lolz

using latitude twice came from here… but their bars on the US map example look sensible :thinking_face:

Interesting to see here:
• low prices come in all conditions and grades (referring to sub 200k)
• High prices usually have a condition of 3+ AND a grade of 4+
• There’s no high grade-low condition-cluster (I assumed this, and it is true)
• Very high condition and very high grade correlate to higher prices, but are likely not the cause of them"

"happy to hop in a breakout room and go through this with you"

only negatives i can see - i think theres a sizing problem - the dashboard is published quite long, not too wide, and in line with my rule about testing everything the users can do, at the moment i can zoom out of the map by mistake - i always turn that feature off :slightly_smiling_face: and change the map to pan, rather than zoom"

"for example question 9 on the RFM:

“You should end up with 3 new dimension (blue) columns per customer - test these out in a view with a subset of customer ids”

so 3 per customer on each metric? i.e. they’re in tier 1 but not in tier 2, not in tier 3?"

"its a contribution to overall profit - so texas is pulling the profit < |from> somewhere else…. bad texas :disappointed:"
"so Texas is spending more than it’s earning?"
"i love the comments and insights Karina! and the colour scheme is also very pleasing. I think its a bit of a busy dashboard, particularly because the box plots are a little visually busy - but its really well constructed and the questions are all great

things i would consider changing - i dont think you need the category legend because we can see it in the top left chart - removing that legend would eliminate the whitespace. and do you need the axis labels and scales on the box plots ? i think that could be dropped too"
"also… though i love the colours - you do need to be careful with the same colour being used more than once to mean different things… pink means technology and high sales :rainbow:"
"Fire in London! Would love to receive some feedback.. :) < #!/vizhome/FireinLondon/dashboardchallenge?publish=yes>"

"no need to be sorry! me too :slightly_smiling_face: if i want to make things look nice it takes AAAGES :slightly_smiling_face:"
"i like this! - fresh approach - nice header colour too! theres a lot in here… i wonder if its a bit busy and you might need to more selective about what you include. but i like the big bubble chart as a global filter for the dashboard - its nice to have big buttons to click on - however i wonder if you can get away without using a title for this view, because its kind of intuitive, and eliminate  some whitespace ? plus, do you intend that if someone clicks on a bubble the other charts change ? it does work, but i wonder if you intend to show this at the end …"
nan
"there are a lot of colours on here- maybe rethink how many colours you want to include in one dashboard - you could use a viz in tooltip or a drill down dashboard instead  - plus, using purple in the header as well as in the rfm segmention ‘lapsed valuable’ could be misinterpreted as purple means x…"
"i like the instructions though and the layout feels quite untuitive, just busy. one way to make it less busy - remove any unnecessary axis labels and titles"
"thank you!!"
welcome!
"fire! theres a fire! good work Francisco. this dashboard is really quite sophisticated in the insights and visually balanced - youve done a good chunk of statistical analysis here and dug into the why, of what makes westminster an outlier. I like the colour scheme (goes well with the fire theme) though i would think about a different colour for the scatter plot- maybe a brown, so it stands out but not too much. also a great use of a polynomial trend line! i hadnt spotted that :slightly_smiling_face:
some tips - i think you could get away without the label ‘borough name’ at least on one of the charts - because its quite intuitive. the chart on the bottom right - i feel like you need a better header that doesnt run out of space.  - maybe something short like ‘popln / borough’
everything else is tidy, but rather than being an interactive dashboard its more of a infographic, because youve answered the questions. It would have been nice to see some interactive pieces with an end user in mind"
"You did a good job. I would remove the stacked columns in the middle (or place them elsewhere,, if they are important) and patternize the colors..."
"and one little fussy  english thing - i think i would prefer “the darker the colour…” rather than “the redder …”  but these are tiny points, i think youve done a great job"

"<@U01RW140HBP> what I'd prefer to display when clicking on the bubbles is highlighting each of them in the rest of the graphs (so instead of changing the graphs, just highlighting their part but keeping the same graphs) i'm not sure if it's possible or even useful :sweat_smile:"
"thats what I would have suggested too! so instead of using that chart as a filter for everything, you can set up a dashboard action - highlight action, and highlight the charts you want"

"I feel you Alex, I’m also usually the last :smile:"
"probably more a question for <#C01S58JN5FT|lab-help>. But anyway...
Yeah, mostly correct. Although there's no hierarchy.

The output (let it be `y_predict` ) is an array with values of the different ""classes"" (like the four flower species in the iris dataset). It is of equal length as the feature dataframe (let it be `X_test` ) which you put in the model to predict them. The metrics for classification (< |True negatives, True positives, False negatives, False positives, accuracy score, F1 error, F2 error, accuracy, precision, recall>, ... ) are then calculated (or directly observable in the confusion matrix) by comparing `y_predict` with `y_test` . The latter is the _Truth,_ the first is the _predicted._ One basically looks for every pair of `y_predic` and `y_test` , how many are there of each combination? And then the confusion matrix is nothing but a tally chart of those possible combinations of the two arrays and in a best case scenario you only have matching pairs, which results in the fact that TN's and TP's are maximized.

So, to answer your last question: No, the order of the predicted label array `y_predicted` doesn't contain any hierarchy. It's just what your model has predicted for every corresponding line of your input dataframe"

If you are struggling maybe consider joining the  JSON files first (then to DataFrame afterwards). This is how I did it - but it wasn't pretty"

*select * from bank.trans t* 
*where t.type = ‘VYDAJ’  AND t.amount &gt; 70000*"

"<@U01RSRE0N3D>  <    It is the same of an inner join actually."
"we will do more on this today in the lesson Karina! do ask any questions you have then"
"ok no problem we will revisit rank this morning but ill also deal with the count"
"it is the syntax in dbeaver, sakila is the database"
"at least in selects, it is needed to specify the database"
"<@U01RW140HBP> is there a way to use max as window function without partition? I was experimenting and trying to filter results where return_date is equal to max return_date. something like:
 select *,
from sakila.RENTAL;
where EXTRACT(MONTH FROM return_date) = max ( EXTRACT(MONTH FROM return_date))"
"i would do this with a self join… hold that thought"
"so the challenge you have here is you cant use the window function as part of the where clause due to the order of execution … they are created in the Select, so cant also be used in Select:
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
this gets you half of the way there… in real life I would normally run the query *select max(return_date) from rental* first, spot that the max month is 9 and then just hard code 9 into my code :
*select *, month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) = 9* 
…. however to do it programmatically, rather than manually, involves either a subquery or a self join - subquery would be the better way to go.
*select * , month(max(return_date) over (order by return_date)) as maxmonth*
*from rental*
*where return_date is not null*  
*and month(return_date) =* 
*( select month(max(return_date))  from rental)*
here the subquery is the same as i started with …

a self join method is actually too messy (i tried a few versions) !"
"try using use sakila ;
then your INSERT INTO statement. But i think you will find there are some constraints on the table which require inserting more information than you have here. if you check the create statement for this table you will see we cant have null entries for
*first name* 
*last name* 
*address id* 
*store id* 
*user name.*
what this means is you will get an error if you try to partially fill a record not completing all those cells.
to get all that information, because we know Tammy is already a customer, you can query her records
*SELECT * FROM sakila.customer*
*where first_name = ‘Tammy’*
then you can amend your insert into statement to include that info
*insert into sakila.staff(first_name, last_name,  address_id, store_id, username)*
*values(‘TAMMY’,‘SANDERS’, 79, 2, ‘tammy’)*
if this doesnt make sense lets jump in a breakout room and go through it later!
*actually the user name is made up…. ‘tammy’ which is not obvious* "
"where is often easier ! and you can combine where with a subquery (we will go through this in tomorrows lecture) so that is flexible. However i normally use joins where i want fields from more than one table."
"if your database is clean, all tables have good referential integrity (ie no missing actor_id), it doesnt matter … in general i suggest to start a join with the transactional table but we dont really have transactions in this join between actors and the bridge table, so it could be done either way."
"select count(distinct actor_id) from film_actor
and
select count(distinct actor_id) from actor

"might be helpful to know how big the bing tiles are - normally the small unit of change captured is 4km square or so …"
"so you dont see if someone moved around in their house or street, but you can see if they go for a walk more than 30 mins and if they took a bus or made a car journey"

"a clarification of what those movement stats mean : The < |Facebook Data for Good program> has released four new datasets pertaining to mobility:
• *< |Movement Range>* comprises two metrics: < |Change in Movement and Stay Put>. The Change in Movement metric is an estimate of the number of the people who are “moving”, i.e., the average number of level 16 < |Bing tiles> (0.6km by 0.6km) that a user was present in during an entire day versus a pre-pandemic baseline. The Stay Put metric estimates the opposite – the number of people who are staying home, i.e., percent of users that were present in only one level 16 Bing tile for at least 3 different hours on a given day."

ok, so in this case you can drag the DS as a filter, choose range of dates, then select week number (keeping it green)
finally change the data type from continuous to discrete (now it goes blue)
this will give you the chance to move between weeks based on their full start date, and will cover both the years

"so a granular histogram is just counting the unique values… you would only see a count of more than 1 (ie a bar above average length) where the same exact value was replicated across multiple cities. I wonder if thats likely in this data set ?
most of the time in the histograms created in python you are systematically ‘binning’ the data points, as in grouping up the values into buckets, so you should see a bar in your histogram which covers similar values, ie the first bar might account for  all the values between 50 and 58, and the next bar would be all values between 58 and 66 .. try experimenting with the bin size as this might help it make more visual sense to you

value is a generic data point  - depending on the other filters used (ie what unit, element, crop) , you will either see yield in hg/ha, production amount in tonnes or area harvested in hectares

• Let’s pretend you work for the company that manufactures and markets a widget
• The company might ask you the following: On the basis of this data, how should we spend our advertising money in the future?
• This general question might lead you to more specific questions:
    a. Is there a relationship between ads and sales?
    b. How strong is that relationship?
    c. Which ad types contribute to sales?
    d. What is the effect of each ad type of sales?
    e. *Given ad spending in a particular market, can sales be predicted?*"
"<@U01S133DZ9A> thought this might be useful for you < 
there is only one variable X in this case, the no of hours studied, but you can better see how the model is evaluated by how closely it predicts y, the % score achieved - where we are fairly sure of a linear relationship (the more i study, the better i do in a test)"

• open your MySQL client and create a new connection, to your local mysql instance - with your uname and password, port 3306
• once the sql dump file is downloaded, do a right click and open with your mysql client 
• run the query - this creates a bank database and populates it with the data

Can you post an example? :blush:"
"i understand the confusion !

if you want to hop on a breakout room and talk it through let me know.
One way to think about averages/counts:
if i do a *select count(column) from table* - i will get one value back - think of *select count(student_name) from bootcamp* - the answer is 23.
same rule applies with *select avg(age) from bootcamp* - the answer is probably around 26
if i want to see more than one row i need to do a group by on each column that isn’t the value aggregated
*- select count(student_name), gender from bootcamp* 
*group by gender* 
would return male : 15 , female:8

I always start with joining the tables i need, select all the fields i want to use across the tables, then think about doing the aggregation using count/avg + groupby

However for qu 6 you are right that we can use one table, transactionhistory, because it has transaction ids and the date-- the challenge here is to extract the month and year for our group by."

say theres a numerical column in my dataframe. In that one column, I want to replace several different integers (lets call them 1,2,3,4,5) with just one integer (let’s say 9).

whats the best way to do that? with a list?"

You have to either overwrite `file3` with the output of that or use the `inplace=True` switch. Otherwise your changes won't be permanent. You just get an output shown, but no changes are made on the dataframe itself. So do something like

```file3 = file3.rename(columns={ 'state':'ST'})```
or
```file3.rename(columns={ 'state':'ST'}, inplace=True)```
I personally prefer the first solution, since not all pandas functions have an `inplace` parameter. And I'm too lazy to memorize which have, and which don't :grin:"

"so I saw that one of the requirements is to delete education and number of complaints columns in the lab and I did as asked but I don’t see that done in the solutions (and I’m not sure if they should be deleted, don’t we need them at all later?). should I delete those or just clean them?"
"ah! case sensitive. your `State` has a capital S"
"u should drop them in the final concatenated file, but not delete them in the original one.
We used `data = data.drop(['number_of_open_complaints'],axis=1)`
to achieve this"

"pah - this should always be my first thing to check !"
thanks!
"case sensitivity annoyed me yesterday as well ^^"
"Yep - its so easy to miss it"
"Yes, I didn't do that in my solutions. But the official ironhack solutions have that (see that there are two notebook files). I instead chose to clean the `number of complaints` column and turn for example those `1/1/0` values into `1` ....
In case of doubt, follow the official Ironhack solutions, because the dataframes you get there at the end, are important for the next Lab. I just didn't see a reason why to drop `education` and `number of complaints`
 :slightly_smiling_face:

But then don't worry. The labs for this week are presented to you in a way that you always get the data with them as they should be processed up to this stage. So, if you couldn't follow with the previous Labs, you can just import the current csv's for that current Lab and work from there."

"Hi, folks. I have questions about Git/GitHub. <@U01SJKB2MG8> <@U01RW140HBP> <@U01RSRE0N3D>

• How can I edit the message of commits?"
"when modelling, how should we choose the value of `test_size` in sklearn? (`random_state` as I understand is just a random number, or?)"
"random state is the base for a randomly generated number, it is there to ensure consitency if I recall correctly.
regarding test_size, we went with 0.7 for testing and 0.3 for predicting, but our model isn’t the most precise"
"you recall correctly… so if you want to compare iterations <@U01RKN0EGDV> you should always use the same random_state (i generally use 40… theres no reason for it i just chose it early on, 100 is the one you often see)"
"the size of the train test split is kind of up to you. worth experimenting with a larger train set to see what impact it is… but to avoid overfitting to the train i normally choose a 60/40 or 70/30 split"
"so then we should have the same random_state in our iterations, but the test_size we can play with it, right?"
exactly!
"just to ensure the data is splitting randomly according to the same system, we keep the random state number the same, then the results are comparable. changing the split is independent of that, the results remain comparable"
"should there be a predict_size or is that calculated from what you put as test_size?"
"i think is calculated, 1- test_size, so just enter test_size"
"the predict size is related to the test size <@U01S7KCL3DF> --- if i have 1000 rows in my test data set (X_test) with n columns, then y_test will be also 1000 rows (one column) and the predictions will be 1000 rows long, one predicted value for each X_test row."

"you can safe the standardscaler you used for the first scaling in a variable and then use that variable to call the exact same scaling again :slightly_smiling_face:"

"Another question:
We should compare the audio features of the input song with the ones in the df of the songs audio feautres we got yesterday and recommend another song based on this (with cluster and all from today).
BUT how do I know the audio feature of the input song, if it e.g. not in my df with all the audio features?

hope this makes sense, maybe we can discuss in class after lunch..."
"i guess by function that gets the audio_features for that input track. but question is how to get track_id from track name because i couldnt find anything like that"
"we can use Alex’s giant database lol"
"Perhaps it would be more interesting if the initial input consisted of characteristics of the song, like a degree of danceability of funkiness."
"<@U01SJKB2MG8>, could we do that?"
"you would have to call the spotify api, but as I pointed out in the morning, the algorithm makes it hard to make sure you got the song the user wanted to have"
"<!channel>,
maybe a more clearer description about what the next step is for today. Start at *2.* Point *1.* is just to establish the link to the previous project steps.
1. Determine the audio features of the input song by querying the Spotify API with it. Store that result in a dataframe or numpy array (if the latter, keep track of which element in the array corresponds to which feature). Don't spend too much time on implementing any guessing that should be done by your program (whether user inputs the correct song). To get a working recommender ready, first assume that the user puts in a track name and/or an artist that *exactly matches* how they are stored in the spotify database.
2. take the vastness of songs you have collected together with their audio features and train a k-means model with them - similar how we did in lecture (scaling is important!). Keep in mind, that it doesn't make sense to train a model, when you have *artist* or *title* *name* or *track id* in the data. You need to however have the possibility to later (after your model has determined the cluster ids) reassign the correct *track ids* to the *rows. Y*ou can do this by just adding back the track id to the dataframe that contains the determined *cluster id's,* but of course only if you haven't shuffled your data rowwise. You can optimize a bit the parameters, but for a first iteration of your model, just go with the default values of KMeans and stick with it. Only improve later by tuning the parameters.
3. ""Predicting"" which *cluster id* a song belongs to, would work like this: take the audio-features of the song and put it into a numpy array, let's say `song_array`. The audio feature order must exactly match the order that the model has learned. Call the model with `KMeans.predict(song_array)` to make the prediction. The outcome is only one cluster
4. The recommendation would then work like this: Take the determined cluster id from *2.* and subset your spotipy dataframe to filter for this cluster with e.g. `df[df[""cluster_id'']==2]` and get a random song back from that subset. You can take a look at < |pandas.DataFrame.sample>"
"Hm yeah makes sense to use function to get track id from track name. Guess I have to search for that then as well.

And yes, we could also ask the user input a feature rather then a song ... 

Hm hm hm lots to do here"
"<@U01RRV4JX6Z> woulnt it then just be a lookup? theres no prediction really"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7> the database is still processing"
"i guess your program should call the spotify api  like thamo said and print back all the top suggestions and make the user choose somehow"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7> 11h28min in , 14 more expected"
"hope they dont block your ip haha"
"well i just assumed that they get more calls more often by other apps accessing their API.. hade some timeout errors yesterday but since then its just running!"
"<@U01S0E0MRJ7>, the idea would be for the user to deliver some characteristics and the computer to randomly assign the user a song with these characteristics..."
"Predicting a song the user might light according to certain parameters"
"<@U01SJKB2MG8> since I ran the data through the standardscaler, can I assume that if i get the data back from spotify i will directly get the right cluster or do I need to scale that data as well?"
"scale it please with the same trained scaler that you used for your training data.
And then its a good idea to take `.fit_transform(X)` apart and do fitting and transforming seperately. So you would do:
```scaler = Standardscaler().fit(X)

X_prep = scaler.transform(X)```
and then later:
```X_song_prep = scaler.transform(X_song)```
"
"why is that? :exploding_head:"
"the splitting part I mean"
"because you want to ""pipe out"" the trained scaler after you fit it and save it. If you do just

`X_prep  = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)`
you don't save it in a variable to be used later"
"that little `scaler` variable contains all the means and standard deviations for all your features and knows how to shift your features"
"The dumb thing is that the spotify df does not have song and artist name. Did i do something wrong?"
"if you only took the IDs, it doesnt have song and artist, i catched it in the step of pulling the song ID"
"the feature extractor does not have song and artist names"
"Via the procedure from monday?"
"in whatever is the step that gives you the song ids, before getting the features"
"but i think that for what we are trying to do, you might not need it?"
"Yeah, that's true, but it seems stupid, though"
"yeah, i guess it's just how they have their internal database set up"
"random question: is there a way to ""save"" a fitted model and import it straight away instead of having to make it learn again in further iterations?"
"yes. pickle it into a pickle < "
thanks!
"And more here:
< "
"pickle it - like preserve it ?"
"can someone help me with this error pls?"
"are the meaning and values of each audio feature somewhere?"
"< "
":smile: eurovision tho haha"
:female-singer:
thanks!!
"i dont know why, but try to change that k,2 to k,30"
"it mitght run but might not be a good result, im still understanding this"
"that doesnt work, dont listen to me! haha"
"maybe <@U01SJKB2MG8> can shine some light on what is being done there more specifically?"
"has anyone managed to get the audio features from a search?"
"you should be able to retrieve the ID of the song you searched, and then use the function to get the features"
"I can’t retrieve the ID"
"what does the search return?"
"a dictionary.
Then I access that dictionary;"
a[‘tracks’][‘items’]
"and that is a list, making it hard to navigate"
"go [0] and see where the id is"
"after tracks and items"
"id might be right there"
"You are an absolute hero, thank you!"
"no worries!"
"i just keep getting higher  silhouette score, the more clusters i add... i mean it doesn’t make sense to have that many clusters, does it?"
"it could! i think it is not very realistic to classify a lot of music tracks in 5 categories! I'm also wondering this so im runnning from 10 to 100 clusters"
"and see if there is a sweet spot in between"
"how many tracks are you working with?"
"Guys, did anybody got the same error while using 'KMeans.predict(song_array)'?"
"my 50k tracks are making me go sloooow"
"my laptop would die haha let me know which amout looks good for u. ill test it too"
"i have 35k"
"Alex, one more question, how did you unpack the features afterwards?"
"```

this is the song array we are using."
"got it, nevermind"
"looks like you didnt train the model, but not sure"
"if i have 51 clusters it splits all my songs in exacrly 699 songs per cluster :smile:"
"tested it and it seems, that piece of code there can't plot `k&gt;5` it seems. still figuring out why"
"ah... I see. It's because the figure is generated as 2 by 2 subplots and the way the plots for the clusters are assigned to the plot areas is determined by this `q, mod = divmod(k, 2)` and `ax=ax[q-1][mod]` expression.
Not really elegant because it only works for 2,3,4,5"
"Sorry to go back to an earlier issue, but: anybody work out how to get the song names ?"
"where are you stuck?"
"Playlist only has IDs - need the song name in our df as well"
"good point!"
"I managed to generate a working code in which, based on a first random recomendation, the computer selects  some more others that a similar to the randomly selected (building on the predictions made). When i replace ""random_song"" with ""filter_song"" in ""getCond = top_100[""cluster""][random_song]"", i get this error.:
```TypeError: Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column```
 Any ideas?"
"i dont get this. i need to add this one song to my whole song dataset and then scale it together? and then take it off again?"
"yeah i took that line off and plotted only the number of clusters i wanted to go for.. no good for comparative analysis but well"
"there is definitely something fishy there"
"yea i think i have some mistake somewhere because all of these 35k songs then correlate on 51 points"
"Once you scaled the data once, you want to save that scaling algo in a variable, so that the exact same scaling happens to new data.

Once you call the spotify api and get the features back, you want to run them through the saved scaler, not the original standardscaler, since using the original one would’nt return a result that is uniform with the scaled dataframe"
"this is because standardscaler takes mean and std and calculates the scaling from there, and that would look a lot different with only one datapoint compared to the whole dataframe"
"`scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X)`"
"and next time you have to scale data you just call `scaler`"
"hope that made sense"
"Which datatypes are `top100` and `random_song` and `filter_song`?"
"top 100 is the dataframe"
"what you mean? I based this on Sian's code"
"I don't know Sians code :blush:"

JOIN sakila.film_category as fc

"
"you could also select ID, but i wanted to see the name rather then just a number :slightly_smiling_face:"
"exactly you only need to refer to one FROM table, but adding JOIN effectively gives us access to two tables Sam, you can select fields from either and both tables"
"and yes once you joined the tables via the shared key, you can select any field"
"i thought i had to have the 'field in common'/join category or whatever in my SELECT :see_no_evil:"
"do we have a copy of the material where you wrote the difference between PK and FK? :innocent:"
"You could use row_number() instead, to make it prettier:
SELECT f.title, f.length,
row_number() over (order by length desc) as 'rank'
FROM sakila.film f
WHERE f.length &lt;&gt; ' ';"
"But in general it should be right as you did it."
"not quite but close… the partition by length in this case is too unique, so we are ranking each length against itself… if i have a film thats 67 minutes long, another thats 80 mins long, and i rank by the partition length…
67 - ranked position 1 compared to itself
80 - ranked position 1 compared to itself

i am guessing you dont actually need a partition in this case. you can rank the films by length using :
*select title, length, rank() over (order by length DESC) as ‘Rank’*
*from sakila.film f*
*where length &lt;&gt; ' ' or length is not null;*"
"so drop the partition"
"oh and i dont know if you want the order to be ASC or DESC thats just a guess… it depends if the longest film is ranked 1st, or the shortest :slightly_smiling_face:"
"ok,, I got it Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:"

What does the question ""Understand the meaning of all columns"" mean?"

• Which columns are numerical?
• Which columns are categorical?
 I think with some columns we can determine certainly whether it is categorical or numerical.

But some have missing values, or are object, which the way I understand it, means that it is of mixed data types.

How would you determine whether the columns are numerical or categorical in that case?

Should we drop the missing values first and then convert the entries in the object columns into it's correct values?"

"good points! these are exactly the challenges to come across with real world data :slightly_smiling_face:
`customer lifetime value` for example is recognized as categorical - actually I would clean it first, cast it as float and add it to the numericals.

so answer: Double check what your first selection of numericals and categoricals is if you use for example `df.select_dtypes(np.number)`

Regarding dropping: Be careful if you drop rows in the categoricals or numericals dataframe only. Because if you later stitch them together, you end up with dataframes differing in length. What I would do here: Not drop any rows in the splitted numericals and categoricals. But before, immediately after concatenating the three dataframes (let's say your dataframe is then `df_all`) , at least drop the rows that have `NaN` values *only*
You can find those out for example with

the future is MANGOS (at least according to the ads that target me on facebook)"
"Oooof how could I miss this?"
"I think it very much depends on the issuing country. While China has the power to make it work, Venezuela clearly doesn't"
"China issued a cryptocurrency (multiple ones, to be fair). The last one has a build in “devalue” function, where the money is worthless if you don’t spend it in x amount of time.
Gouvernments controlling our currency is the reason for so many economic problems, I honestly hope that the new version of money we are going to use get’s rid of these flaws.
Build in inflation mechnanisms and incentives to spend the money quickly and not save it, is definetly not what society needs"
"And also definetly true what you say, but I wouldnt call it cryptourrency anymore, but electronic money.
And we definetly need layer 2 money applications that scale quicker than bitcoin.
I just hope we will get rid of one currency per country/area but adopt one global solution"
"I agree with you that this mechanism may be problematic. But it has been disproven that there is a sound correlation between government printing money and inflation."
"This is why economic orthodoxy moved from  Friedman to the new consensus macroeconomics/DSGE models"
"Reflecting more about it, there is a reason why the Chinese force people to use it in a certain period of time. To be money, a given unit of account like salt, metal or whatever you want must satisfy several requirements. One of this is to be an effetive unit of account, in that its value does not oscillate wildly with time, like in a scenario of hyperinflation. In short, it must effectively guide expectations for the wide public. If the chinese criptocurrency works exactly like bitcoin it wont have this property, at least not for everyone. I guess forcing people to use it before a certain deadline is a form of stabilizing its value. But I agree with you that this does not make sense if the other objective is to make it attractive for the regular investor and thus grant it with liquidity, which is another one of the desirable properties of money. I guess that not only the Chinese, but also the Americans and the Europeans, which probably will experiment with this policy solution, will have to find an adequate mix here.. Its all about policy experimentation. But I'm quiet confident that this government-generated cryptocurrency is the future, because the state is the lender of last resort and the entity ultimately responsible for stabilizing expectations and the business cycle..."

So just to finish what was said in the break out room.

Luke (Skywalker)  has the same name as the director of Star Wars, or is at least derived from it, hence George Lucas.

George Lucas channeled his hero journey into the movies :slightly_smiling_face:"
"burn the heretic"
:smile:
ahahaha
"SW is overrrated!!!!!"
"just kidding, deep down if you look at the star wars series in analytical eyes its all about a family story, how the father was bad, and distant from the family but then the son came up as a good guy and convinced him to become good in the end"
"George was also Darth Vader's middle name... Fun fact"
"We SW orthodoxs don't say his name (G****e) anymore, <@U01RXCQHMHT>"
"there are a lot of layers in star wars movies, depends how you look at it"
"Strar wars? Is that a sequel to Harry Potter or?"
"and there it goes the controversy"
"i have something else to say"
"THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS 10H OF PEOPLE WALKING"
"George Lucas was into Joseph Campbell and Jung I think.  So the way I see it is that each character is symbolic and represents parts of Lucas' psyche."
absolutely
blasphemy!!!!!!!
"but thats what people do in their movies, and why tarantino shows a lot of feet"
"well that escalated quickly"
"It's like Jung wrote the Red Book. Tolkien wrote LOTR."
"is this a good time to mention that though I have never seen star wars, i have been to the set at elstree studios where SW trilogy was filmed and ate in the canteen of the George Lucas Stage next to the big gold robot thing… not sure whats thats called"

"<@U01SJKB2MG8>, i was checking the German constitution and it does not say that decent and affordable housing is a basic right, like it is in Brazil. I guess that this reflects the better material conditions of Germany when its constitution was proclaimed. Perhaps by now this should change. What i wanted to say before was that lawmaking is not an exact science, as it is very much subject to interpretation. If one lobbyst says ""this is inconstutional"" and goes to court another one might say ""yeah, but here it says it is not"". Unfortunately peoples' basic rights tend not to be much considered these days"
"_Das Land habe seine Kompetenzen überschritten,_ says exactly what I said:slightly_smiling_face:, the state of Berlin overstepped its jurisdiction. The court did not rule that the matter of the law itself violates any article of the German basic law, the Grundgesetz - which initself is imho relieving :clap: and gratifying for both our sentiment, that there should be a basic right for housing one day in Germany. Because now there's still legal room for it to make such a law on federal level - which won't happen though if CDU/CSU should also win the next election :face_with_rolling_eyes:"

"Wouldn’t this lead only to a higher velocity of the money, not necesseraly to a more stable value?
In any way, it gives an incentive to spend rather than safe, and that is definitely not attractive to investors.

But yes, electronic currencies will be the future, no doubt. Digital societies need digital money.
But, just between me and you, I don’t want people to see what I do or don’t do with my money, and as long as privacy is not 100% solved (though there is ZEC, Zedcash, which does a decent job, and monero, XRM which is also very good) , the development is not there yet."

"I dont know much about bitcoins, but i undestand quiet well how oil financial markets work. And there is true that price is driven not by retail investors, but by key investors"
"My whole trading hypthesis is, that markets are constantly manipulated by the large key investors. You can see their traces in price and volume movements, its quite hard to hide billions of dollars in the chart.
And if you think about it, these players need to engineer the liquidity for their positions.
They often do this by ‘generating’ news that drives price into retail stops or force margin calls with large swings of price.
In unrgegulated markets, this is even worse, and thats why people are under the impression it is dangerous to trade, when in reality you just have to wait for the wave and ride it"
"Yes, this is precisely what i read regarding energy markets"
"The OPEC is publicly setting price targets and making non-sell-agreements, aren’t they?"
"Yes, that's what they do"
"It doesnt always work"
"But in petroleum markets prices are set in financial markets (brent futures ..). These are also influenced by these large traders"
"Usually the dynamic is the other way round, spot trading sets an index for future trading.
But I was there when brent futures went negative, and my broker didn’t allow me to buy below 0.

"I think there's no need in treating Pandas as a new language, since it is just a library living in the Python ecosystem. But I get your sentiment. It takes time to get used to the datatypes (dataframe, series, index, ....) and how to interact with them - address columns, subset a dataframe etc.

Two thoughts following this:
1- I think I will treat Pandas as a separate language to learn. It seems like all the functions and use of brackets are distinct from the Python rules. - and maybe on its own it is not so complex to learn (+ I guess one of the most useful for everyday stuff)
2- Within Python, I find List Comprehension (where we put loops in one line)  really tough to get my head around."
